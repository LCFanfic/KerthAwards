    "Summary": "What if all the worst parts of your personality came together to lead you to the right decision, but for all the wrong reasons? When Clark gets a tip that\u0027s too hot for him to handle, he has to make a decision that could melt his relationship with Lois into lava. This is a light story, with a little swath of angst, a little dash of WAFFY-ness and a LOT of silly choices that the original series probably could have gotten away with in the 90\u0027s, but television really couldn\u0027t get away with now.  (We\u0027ll see if the fic gets away with it.)"
