<p>I really really love that this one won an award because I’m really so proud of how it came out! I love being able to participate in the ficathon challenges because getting the list of prompts… wants/​don’t wants makes my brain think in creative ways. Thanks to Blueowl for the prompts and to Verity for managing the guess the author ficathon logistics and to everyone who read and wrote!</p>
