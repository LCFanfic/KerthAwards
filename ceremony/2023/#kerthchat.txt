2023-04-30 20:14:41 *	Now talking on #kerthchat
2023-04-30 21:41:57 <Meadowlark>	Hi!  I am new to Mibbit.  Could someone please tell me how to start a Log of this?
2023-04-30 21:46:34 <KathyB>	Hello everyone! We're so glad to see you here!
2023-04-30 21:47:01 <KSaraSara>	I'm not sure how to start a log on Mibbit! But we do have two people logging and will have a side-by-side transcript available after the ceremony!
2023-04-30 21:47:17 <KathyB>	Meadowlark, hopefully someone will figure it out! This is a blast from the past, alright!
2023-04-30 21:48:06 <AnnieM>	T-13 minutes until the ceremony starts! Does everyone have their drink/snack/etc ready?!
2023-04-30 21:48:10 <Meadowlark>	Ok, a Transcript would great.  
2023-04-30 21:49:01 <AnnieM>	The side by side transcripts are great because you can see the chat room reactions along with the ceremony
2023-04-30 21:49:15 <KSaraSara>	... I'm still drinking my coffee... thanks to my thermal mug... it's still got a touch of warmth to it lol

2023-04-30 21:51:18 <Meadowlark>	Think I found part of the logging.  If you are logged in, at the top right open "Prefs", then General tab, there is a check box. The opt to Save must be somewhere else.
2023-04-30 21:53:41 <Meadowlark>	It's nice to have this back on IRC.  I haven't been here is a long time.
2023-04-30 21:54:00 <KSaraSara>	Same here! It's a blast from the past! 
2023-04-30 21:54:05 <Doranwen>	I love IRC. :D
2023-04-30 21:54:05 <KathyB>	Ah, that's probably why I don't see it. I'm not logged in. Gosh, this really takes me back!
2023-04-30 21:54:34 <Doranwen>	I'm on it a lot these days keeping an eye on ArchiveTeam stuff, but most of fandom has sadly moved to other pastures.
2023-04-30 21:54:52 <AnnieM>	It's been a solid 20 years since I was on IRC. Definitely a blast from the past.
2023-04-30 21:55:27 <KSaraSara>	But surely we're not that old?? LOL
2023-04-30 21:56:13 <AnnaBtG>	@KSaraSara: we definitely don't look it! üòÅ
2023-04-30 21:56:25 <AnnaBtG>	(speaking of which, how does my emoji look?)
2023-04-30 21:56:31 <Doranwen>	AnnaBtG: Super tiny and hard to read.
2023-04-30 21:56:54 <AnnaBtG>	I took it from the keyboard 
2023-04-30 21:57:03 <Meadowlark>	So some of you have been around here for a long time.  Before this starts, can I share some sad news?  Don't want to be a downner.
2023-04-30 21:57:07 <Doranwen>	It's too small to show the amount of detail necessary to identify.  I'd recommend sticking with the text-based emoticons.
2023-04-30 21:57:55 <AnnaBtG>	@Meadowlark: sounds like something we'd be interested in hearing nevertheless 
2023-04-30 21:58:01 <Meadowlark>	If you don't already know this, we lost ChrisPat in December of 2022.
2023-04-30 21:58:18 <Meadowlark>	This was posted on the older MBs.

2023-04-30 22:34:07 <Doranwen>	Eh, it wasn't too hard in my one fic - but it was a lot of quick kisses, and the focus was on the different languages.  I don't write long in-depth kisses, period.
2023-04-30 22:34:09 <KSaraSara>	LOL! Yes!
2023-04-30 22:34:10 <KathyB>	So MANY!!!
2023-04-30 22:34:12 <Blueowl_>	:* ;*
2023-04-30 22:34:14 *	Darth_Michael eyes nKerths
2023-04-30 22:34:23 <AnnieM>	So much cringing
2023-04-30 22:34:23 <KathyB>	And then trying to keep it PG, ahem 
2023-04-30 22:34:24 <KSaraSara>	Hahaha Michael
2023-04-30 22:34:42 *	KSaraSara digs around for the fire emoji...
2023-04-30 22:34:42 <Doranwen>	I can't imagine how hard it would be for anyone who does.
2023-04-30 22:34:54 <AnnieM>	So much me messaging Kathy being like "This is so awkward, the readers will think I've never actually kissed anyone!"
2023-04-30 22:35:05 <KSaraSara>	^ yup
2023-04-30 22:35:28 <Darth_Michael>	just have Lois kiss Claude. that way, any cringe is due to the subject matter, not the presentaiton!
2023-04-30 22:35:34 <Doranwen>	LOL
2023-04-30 22:35:36 <Bek>	Ewwww
2023-04-30 22:35:40 <KathyB>	LOL
2023-04-30 22:35:49 <AnnieM>	noooooooo
2023-04-30 22:35:51 <Blueowl_>	Writing romance is already hard for me, so kissing scenes.... I'm always so impressed when I read fics with great romance
2023-04-30 22:36:01 <KSaraSara>	Noooooo boooo Claude
2023-04-30 22:36:25 <AnnieM>	I love how many of these literally have Kiss in the title ;)
2023-04-30 22:36:35 <KSaraSara>	haha
2023-04-30 22:36:54 <bakasi>	Also, if you have many kisses, you can't use the same words all the time
2023-04-30 22:36:59 <AnnieM>	YES
2023-04-30 22:37:11 <Bek>	That's the real problem!
2023-04-30 22:37:16 <AnnieM>	it's hard enough writing ONE kiss, let alone a story full of kisses that can't all be cut/paste
2023-04-30 22:37:18 <Blueowl_>	yeah, very repetitive
2023-04-30 22:37:47 <KathyB>	oh wow!!!
2023-04-30 22:37:52 <Darth_Michael>	Congratulations you guys!
2023-04-30 22:37:54 <KSaraSara>	Yay!!! SOOOOO many kisses in that one! lol

2023-04-30 22:39:05 <Meadowlark>	Congrats!  Am I the only one wondering which kiss won in this story?  Maybe it was all of them?
2023-04-30 22:39:18 *	Doranwen applauds the winners
2023-04-30 22:39:43 <KathyB>	LOL I was already planning to reread the story this week, and now I'm going to be paying extra attention to the kisses. Not that I can fully rmember which ones I wrote and which ones Annie did, haha
2023-04-30 22:39:50 <Doranwen>	Lol
2023-04-30 22:39:52 <KSaraSara>	ALL the kisses, I'm sure! LOL
2023-04-30 22:40:10 <KSaraSara>	Speech!! ;)
2023-04-30 22:40:17 <bakasi>	Yeah, the whole story was so great, it'd be hard to choose
2023-04-30 22:40:24 <Blueowl_>	üòô
2023-04-30 22:40:47 <KSaraSara>	Gahhh! Yes, the chemistry is... off the charts!

2023-04-30 22:42:21 <AnnaBtG>	Believe me, writing a speech about the best kiss was about as hard as writing a kiss, lol xD
2023-04-30 22:42:28 <Doranwen>	Haha
2023-04-30 22:42:30 <KathyB>	Great speech Anna!

2023-04-30 22:47:48 <Bek>	Eep! Thank you all!
2023-04-30 22:49:31 <Darth_Michael>	live speech 
2023-04-30 22:49:33 <Darth_Michael>	live speech!
2023-04-30 22:49:39 <KSaraSara>	Whew...
2023-04-30 22:50:06 <AnnaBtG>	Yay Jerseygrl!!
2023-04-30 22:50:19 <Doranwen>	Oh, it's the special apostrophe that's doing the weird chars for me.  Anyone else seeing it oddly too?
2023-04-30 22:50:43 <bakasi>	Me too
2023-04-30 22:50:43 <AnnaBtG>	No?
2023-04-30 22:50:50 <AnnaBtG>	But I'm on an app
2023-04-30 22:50:55 <Darth_Michael>	yep, it's broken, even in the log
2023-04-30 22:51:00 <Doranwen>	The curly apostrophe and quote marks don't show up right on my IRC, either.
2023-04-30 22:51:01 <Darth_Michael>	need to fix that later on
2023-04-30 22:51:03 <Demi2>	Me too
2023-04-30 22:51:20 <AnnieM>	yeah, it's broken for me too. Weird. That seems like a pretty basic symbol that should translate
2023-04-30 22:51:24 <Doranwen>	Guess that's a warning to all presenters - make sure whatever you're typing it in doesn't autoformat them.  We didn't test that‚Ä¶  Oops.
2023-04-30 22:51:43 <Doranwen>	It's a specialty character, it's not the default one.  IRC has a more limited symbol set I think?  Not sure.
2023-04-30 22:52:11 <AnnaBtG>	I wonder if that repeated pasting is Tempus messing with the timeline...
2023-04-30 22:52:22 <Doranwen>	It does seem a likely explanation‚Ä¶
2023-04-30 22:52:34 <KathyB>	LOL
2023-04-30 22:52:53 <KathyB>	Luckily ,we can fix it in the transcript!
2023-04-30 22:53:05 <KSaraSara>	... it's me... I mean.. yes...Tempus
2023-04-30 22:53:13 <Doranwen>	Rofl
2023-04-30 22:53:18 <bakasi>	Or there's a cat pounding on the laptop?
2023-04-30 22:53:34 <bakasi>	In case I fail, I will claim Houdini is responsible
2023-04-30 22:53:44 *	Darth_Michael eyes script
2023-04-30 22:54:01 <Darth_Michael>	no, Cat is not pounding on the laptop. she's boffing on the copier
2023-04-30 22:54:21 <Songbird2>	My cat disconnected me from the chat earlier. He's so helpful. 
2023-04-30 22:54:29 <Doranwen>	Yeah, even the triple dot ellipsis doesn't show up right.  With IRC it's definitely best to avoid those specialty punctuation characters, I guess!  Now we know.
2023-04-30 22:54:31 <Doranwen>	LOL bad kitty
2023-04-30 22:54:48 <Songbird2>	Yes! 
2023-04-30 22:55:17 <KSaraSara>	Yeah.... New interface for me... lol
2023-04-30 22:55:23 <KSaraSara>	I didn't practice *hides* lol
2023-04-30 22:55:47 <Bek>	Jerseygrl also writes a bunch of Superman and Lois fic too, on AO3 if anyone is interested!
2023-04-30 22:56:02 <Darth_Michael>	actually a bunch of characters does work: ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù
2023-04-30 22:56:11 <Doranwen>	Yeah, that's the funny thing, I've typed them before.
2023-04-30 22:56:14 <KathyB>	That wasn't your fault, Sara ... none of us realized the smart quotes wouldn't paste right. 
2023-04-30 22:56:18 <Doranwen>	So I wonder what happened with the pasting there?
2023-04-30 22:56:31 <KSaraSara>	Oh, the pasting was totally my fault
2023-04-30 22:56:34 <AnnieM>	I wonder if it's a specific font that is the problem
2023-04-30 22:56:42 <Doranwen>	AnnieM: That's what I was thinking.
2023-04-30 22:56:51 <Darth_Michael>	that's what Labby's pins are for
2023-04-30 22:56:53 <KSaraSara>	The extra hard return at the end made it seem like my pasted hadn't made it to the text box... so... yep. 
2023-04-30 22:57:23 <AnnieM>	SO many good challenge response stories this year! So many awesome challenges
2023-04-30 22:57:23 <Doranwen>	Might be just that one font.  Either way, it isn't too hard to avoid now that we know it can behave problematically.
2023-04-30 22:57:32 <Doranwen>	We just didn't know before this.
2023-04-30 22:57:45 <KSaraSara>	I love that basaki wrote this for me and I'd been writing a rewrite of the same scene! LOL
2023-04-30 22:57:53 <KathyB>	LOL
2023-04-30 22:59:02 <AnnieM>	I can't even remember who I voted for in this category. I love them all.
2023-04-30 22:59:20 <Bek>	All of these stories are amazing!
2023-04-30 22:59:31 <KSaraSara>	Yes, they are!!

2023-04-30 22:59:56 <bakasi>	I thought you deserved a nice story after reading my other WIP ;=

2023-04-30 23:03:39 <Blueowl_>	Is it a knitted sock?
2023-04-30 23:03:40 <AnnaBtG>	It's blue with an S, obviously!
2023-04-30 23:03:42 <AnnieM>	I love how Sara managed to make her speech about Canada/Hockey.

2023-04-30 23:18:47 <AnnaBtG>	@Meadowlark: hah I was just wishing for a tie in the next category I'm presenting so I could make that joke xD
2023-04-30 23:18:47 <KathyB>	I'm so glad SaraM didn't give up and SaraO finally buckled under the pressure!!
2023-04-30 23:18:51 <Darth_Michael>	LOL, like the actor needing to get pushed to take the Oscar role
2023-04-30 23:19:34 <Blueowl_>	That's hilarious üòÇ
2023-04-30 23:19:54 <Doranwen>	I think of Viggo Mortensen asking his son if he should take the role of Aragorn in LOTR, knowing it'd mean a big time commitment‚Ä¶  (Fortunately for all of us his son was like YES, Dad, DOOOOOOO ITTTTTTT)
2023-04-30 23:20:28 *	Bek applauds all the winners so far
2023-04-30 23:20:57 *	Darth_Michael has no idea how many ties there are. only my excel sheet knows

2023-04-30 23:21:56 <Doranwen>	Fic is *way* better.
2023-04-30 23:21:57 <KSaraSara>	OMG let's not talk about the ARGH lol
2023-04-30 23:23:09 <Doranwen>	Yeah, I think it was your font only, Sara - Annie's paste has curly apostrophes and they're not showing up weird.
2023-04-30 23:23:25 <KSaraSara>	Yess! Toomi finally explains the Kryptonite cage's disappearance to us!
2023-04-30 23:23:56 <Bek>	Congrats Toomi!
2023-04-30 23:23:57 <KathyB>	Congratulations, Toomi!!!
2023-04-30 23:24:00 <AnnaBtG>	Oooh congrats Toomi!!!

2023-04-30 23:24:14 <Darth_Michael>	Congratulations, Toomi!
2023-04-30 23:24:20 <KSaraSara>	YAY TOOMI! Such a great way to make the end of HoL realistic!!

2023-04-30 23:25:34 <KathyB>	LOL Doranwen
2023-04-30 23:25:44 <KSaraSara>	Yes, I loved Henderson here!
2023-04-30 23:26:19 <Toomi>	I think far too many of my stories get a good start in the winter when I'm hiding from the weather :)
2023-04-30 23:26:48 *	KSaraSara is waiting patiently for her snowbound story from Toomi lol
2023-04-30 23:26:53 <Doranwen>	Lol
2023-04-30 23:27:20 <Toomi>	I told you.... an A plot took hold and ran off with it. You'll get it, eventually... but it'll be bigger.
2023-04-30 23:27:48 <AnnaBtG>	Time for my eye drops!
2023-04-30 23:28:50 <Darth_Michael>	Snowbound? LOL, there's a fascinating amount of stories where LnC are stuck in snow and ...stuff happens
2023-04-30 23:29:22 <Doranwen>	It's a classic fic trope :D
2023-04-30 23:31:03 <Toomi>	Yes. I thought I'd take a shot at a 'snowbound' fic. It was supposed to be a shorty but then I had a duel with my muse and lost. However, I did put my foot down when pirates were brought into it.
2023-04-30 23:31:13 <Doranwen>	LOL
2023-04-30 23:31:53 <AnnaBtG>	Hahaha
2023-04-30 23:33:12 <KSaraSara>	lol!
2023-04-30 23:33:21 <KSaraSara>	And LOL at the commercials!
2023-04-30 23:34:21 <AnnaBtG>	You can be beside yourself, literally!
2023-04-30 23:34:25 <AnnaBtG>	Lol!
2023-04-30 23:35:09 <KSaraSara>	OMG "It's perfect for parties or hostage situations!" *dies laughing*
2023-04-30 23:36:56 <AnnieM>	 OMG this song
2023-04-30 23:37:34 <Doranwen>	I've never actually listened to this song enough to know it.  Maybe I've heard it once?  But don't remember how it goes.
2023-04-30 23:38:18 <AnnaBtG>	Me neither, but the lyrics are awesome!! I'm going to listen to it as soon as I get an opportunity!
2023-04-30 23:39:02 <Doranwen>	I know I've heard it once, now that I think about it.  But I'll have to listen to it again to hear how the lyrics fit to it because I don't remember the melody at all.
2023-04-30 23:39:35 <Blueowl_>	Catching up. Congrats Toomi üòÄ
2023-04-30 23:41:48 <KSaraSara>	Thanks for being a digital packrat, Kathy!! (You're not alone in that lol)
2023-04-30 23:41:59 <Darth_Michael>	hear hear
2023-04-30 23:42:13 <Doranwen>	Digital packrat?  I resemble that remark XD
2023-04-30 23:42:19 <Darth_Michael>	the true reason why computer storage goes up an order of magnitude every couple of years
2023-04-30 23:42:26 <KSaraSara>	HAHA TRUTH
2023-04-30 23:42:26 <Darth_Michael>	nerds are horders
2023-04-30 23:42:35 *	Doranwen eyes her many hdds stuffed full of data from years and years ago.
2023-04-30 23:42:35 <KSaraSara>	^
2023-04-30 23:42:38 <AnnieM>	Thank goodness for Kathy and Sara and their digital packrat natures, because I personally save nothing and they have gifted me many gems I had long forgotten
2023-04-30 23:42:52 <KSaraSara>	Ack! I'm presenting again... bear with me lol
2023-04-30 23:42:57 <KathyB>	Unfortunately, sometimes in the wrong fandom, hahahha
2023-04-30 23:43:07 <Doranwen>	Lol
2023-04-30 23:43:07 <CRene>	I have lost so much stuff online because I didn't save it on other places.  Now I love the cloud.  
2023-04-30 23:43:37 <Blueowl_>	Yeah, I HATE losing electronic stuff so much, especially pics or vids
2023-04-30 23:43:37 *	Darth_Michael loves that contradictory statement by CarrieRene
2023-04-30 23:43:40 <Doranwen>	I have double backups now.  One stored here, one stored elsewhere.  I have too much data to put in the cloud.
2023-04-30 23:43:49 <Doranwen>	But I do store a few things up on Mega to make it easy to share.
2023-04-30 23:43:53 <AnnieM>	LOL true. Her packrat gifts derailed me into another fandom. BUT she also had saved all our old chatlogs from when we wrote Tea Totaled. And those were a joy to behold.
2023-04-30 23:44:18 <Doranwen>	I love AUs and elseworlds!  In pretty much any fandom
2023-04-30 23:44:32 <Doranwen>	He really is
2023-04-30 23:45:12 <AnnieM>	AUs are always my favorite categories. I love seeing the characters in a totally different scenario yet still themselves
2023-04-30 23:45:23 <Doranwen>	Yup
2023-04-30 23:45:33 <CRene>	I had a desktop that was built for me.  It had 3 drives on it.  I even had it moved to a external drive, but lost the drive.  So bye the first 4 years of pictures of my oldest child, plus stories, videos, and more.
2023-04-30 23:45:41 <Blueowl_>	Yeah, there can never be too many of them
2023-04-30 23:45:44 <KSaraSara>	Oh heck... the envelope made me lose the awards chat...
2023-04-30 23:45:48 <KathyB>	OMG, the chat logs from Tea Totaled were a joy to behold. Especially since you couldn't tell the difference in how we talk to each other from 20 years ago and today hahahah
2023-04-30 23:45:54 <KSaraSara>	The epic envelope fumble...
2023-04-30 23:46:09 <Darth_Michael>	oops
2023-04-30 23:46:19 <KathyB>	do you need me to paste?
2023-04-30 23:46:28 <Darth_Michael>	I thought it would just open in the back and be ready
2023-04-30 23:46:35 <Doranwen>	Lol, who needs to invent envelope fumbles?  They happen naturally easily enough! <g>
2023-04-30 23:47:17 <Darth_Michael>	@Kathy so, basically, you didn't learn anything to write better fics in the time since then?
2023-04-30 23:47:23 <KSaraSara>	Haha yes, paste the rest of the nominees, please! :D
2023-04-30 23:47:24 *	Darth_Michael eyes currents stats
2023-04-30 23:47:34 <Darth_Michael>	then again, why improve on percfection
2023-04-30 23:47:56 <Doranwen>	A much better response, lol
2023-04-30 23:48:13 *	KSaraSara has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2023-04-30 23:48:18 <Darth_Michael>	LOL
2023-04-30 23:48:27 <Darth_Michael>	should I?
2023-04-30 23:48:33 <Doranwen>	Poor Sara
2023-04-30 23:48:34 <Blueowl_>	The suspense XD
2023-04-30 23:48:41 <Doranwen>	Blueowl_: LOL yes!
2023-04-30 23:48:41 <AnnaBtG>	Sara amping up the suspense!

2023-04-30 23:49:43 <KSaraSara>	And CONGRATS to WTHW!!!
2023-04-30 23:49:48 <Blueowl_>	I'm rereading this story now :D
2023-04-30 23:50:16 <Doranwen>	Congrats
2023-04-30 23:50:19 <Doranwen>	!
2023-04-30 23:50:48 <Songbird2>	For some reason I'm not getting everything that is typed on the awards channel. Congrats to Annie and Kathy!
2023-04-30 23:51:01 <Doranwen>	Songbird2: You're logged in there as Songbird, without the 2.
2023-04-30 23:51:16 <Doranwen>	Do you have a separate browser window open for that one?
2023-04-30 23:51:35 <Songbird2>	Yes. I'm actually using two tablets
2023-04-30 23:51:42 <Doranwen>	Ah, OK, I do see you in there.
2023-04-30 23:52:07 <Doranwen>	You could try closing the Songbird one and re-joining it to see if that fixes whatever you're experiencing?
2023-04-30 23:52:13 <Doranwen>	Sometimes the close-and-restart method really does work, lol.
2023-04-30 23:52:31 <Songbird2>	Okay. I'll try that. Thanks! 
2023-04-30 23:52:37 <KSaraSara>	I actually got to be privy to a portion of that and gahhhhh!!
2023-04-30 23:52:59 <Darth_Michael>	oh, actually, @Doranwen, can you log in twice with the same name on the same server? or maybe just when you're using an authenicated user?
2023-04-30 23:53:10 <Doranwen>	No, you have to have different nicks.
2023-04-30 23:53:34 <Meadowlark>	There is backstory???  Maybe that is for Part 3/
2023-04-30 23:53:38 <Doranwen>	You can join two channels with both but with Mibbit you can't actually see them at the same time.
2023-04-30 23:53:40 <Darth_Michael>	hey, guys, the author name alone is reason to put this on the must-read list. 
2023-04-30 23:53:45 <AnnaBtG>	Hahahaha @KSaraSara !
2023-04-30 23:53:48 *	Darth_Michael eyes loooong list
2023-04-30 23:54:07 <Doranwen>	So the guide suggested opening two separate browsers - with separate nicks so the dual connection can happen.  Two different tablets/phones/etc. also would do the trick that way.
2023-04-30 23:54:27 <Doranwen>	Or even two different actual apps - there are IRC apps for phones after all, but not all are free and some can be tricky to work.
2023-04-30 23:54:33 <KSaraSara>	@Michael... better get those treats ready!
2023-04-30 23:54:35 <Doranwen>	Mibbit was far easier for a newbie to figure out.
2023-04-30 23:54:43 <Doranwen>	So that's why we went with that.
2023-04-30 23:55:08 <Doranwen>	But most phones can't do a split screen so you're kind of stuck if you only have a single phone to do it on.  Have to switch back and forth a lot.
2023-04-30 23:55:26 <Doranwen>	Songbird2: Are you seeing it OK now?
2023-04-30 23:55:40 <Darth_Michael>	yes, but if I offer one now, can you imagine Houdini dragging Bakasi off the stage during the speach?
2023-04-30 23:55:51 <Songbird2>	Yes, I think so. Thanks for all the help!
2023-04-30 23:55:52 <KSaraSara>	LOL!
2023-04-30 23:55:55 <Doranwen>	Excellent. :)
2023-04-30 23:56:33 <Songbird2>	Is this long story?
2023-04-30 23:56:34 *	Darth_Michael holds out envelope and treat
2023-04-30 23:56:40 <KSaraSara>	Yes, Songbird :)
2023-04-30 23:56:42 <Darth_Michael>	Houdini, fetch!
2023-04-30 23:56:48 <Songbird2>	Thanks!
2023-04-30 23:56:51 <KSaraSara>	LOL @Michael
2023-04-30 23:56:56 <Doranwen>	Lol
2023-04-30 23:57:09 <KSaraSara>	Yes it was SOOOO HARD TO CHOOSE (actually... all the categories were...)
2023-04-30 23:57:47 <KSaraSara>	Congrats again!!!!!
2023-04-30 23:57:49 <Darth_Michael>	Congratulations Annie and Kathy!

2023-05-01 00:00:01 <bakasi>	Again, congratulations.
2023-05-01 00:00:01 <KSaraSara>	lol
2023-05-01 00:00:12 <KathyB>	Thank you all! Annie wrote 90% of this story, so she deserves all the kudos. It was such a job working with her!!!
2023-05-01 00:00:12 <Doranwen>	Was just typing that, lol
2023-05-01 00:00:16 <Darth_Michael>	JOKER: I can make people die with laughter
2023-05-01 00:00:22 <Doranwen>	I've laughed till I cried with a few fics.
2023-05-01 00:00:50 <Demi2>	Congratulations

2023-05-01 00:05:39 <Doranwen>	Thanks for the obvious mic handoff, Toomi - makes it easy to know when you're done. :)
2023-05-01 00:06:19 <Toomi>	Haha. I was trying not to flee the stage. Hadn't thought I'd win anything so I have no idea what to say. 
2023-05-01 00:06:20 *	Doranwen has been guessing all afternoon.  "Are they finished talking?  Maybe?  I think?"
2023-05-01 00:06:40 *	Darth_Michael is just at the point when Lois invites Clark over for coffee in Pearl Jam!

2023-05-01 00:12:34 <Darth_Michael>	LOLZ. I did mention typos, didn't I?
2023-05-01 00:12:36 <Songbird2>	Congrats Bek!! 12 fics is amazing! Thank you! 
2023-05-01 00:12:59 <AnnaBtG>	@Bek: congrats and we are so happy to have you here!!
2023-05-01 00:13:12 <Bek>	Ahh, thank you!!!
2023-05-01 00:13:12 <Doranwen>	It sounds like a different fandom, lol.  L&Cdom doesn't have much slash in it.  Now, Smallville, otoh‚Ä¶
2023-05-01 00:13:30 <KSaraSara>	Yes, we're so lucky to have Bek here!!!
2023-05-01 00:13:41 <Doranwen>	Agreed
2023-05-01 00:13:46 <Bek>	Thank you all for being so welcoming!! 
2023-05-01 00:13:46 <Darth_Michael>	Yes, though there are one or two fics with two Clarks in one bedroom.
2023-05-01 00:14:11 <KSaraSara>	HAH! Wouldn't that be a sight to see....?
2023-05-01 00:14:12 <Sara>	Managed to make it for some of it but I'm on my phone so I am not really "here" here. Congratulations Bek!!!
2023-05-01 00:14:31 <KathyB>	I did once read a Clark/Jimmy story years back ... but slash is indeed pretty rare in this fandom
2023-05-01 00:14:32 <Doranwen>	Yeah, didn't say it had none, just not a lot in comparison with some.  Someone on a Reddit post the other day was actually asking for fandom names that were almost entirely het, and I offered up L&C as an example.
2023-05-01 00:14:34 <Bek>	Hmmmm, two Clarks huh?
2023-05-01 00:15:08 <Doranwen>	So I hear!
