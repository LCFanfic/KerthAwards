2023-04-30 22:01:55 <KathyB>	Just a reminder that this channel will be for the ceremony only, but we have open chatting in #kerthchat

2023-04-30 22:06:47 <KathyB>	Hello everyone, and welcome to the 25th Annual Lois & Clark Fanfic Kerth Awards! And a big thank you to the Kerth Committee for inviting me to act as Master of Ceremonies for tonight‚Äôs Jubilee celebration!

2023-04-30 22:07:40 <KathyB>	Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman debuted nearly 30 years ago (!) on September 12, 1993, and the online fandom began gathering very soon thereafter. To the best of my knowledge, the first L&C-specific fanfic was ‚ÄúCounter Clark-Wise‚Äù, written by Zoomway in the summer of 1994. The Lois & Clark Fanfic Archive now boasts 4,278 stories, and that‚Äôs not e
2023-04-30 22:07:50 <KathyB>	and that‚Äôs not even counting all the recent stories that have not yet been uploaded or the many stories rated above PG-13 that are housed elsewhere. 
2023-04-30 22:08:04 <KathyB>	The Kerth Awards have a similarly long and wonderful history. In the spring of 1998, Leanne Shawler mentioned that a previous fandom she‚Äôd been involved with had done fanfic awards. 
2023-04-30 22:08:11 <KathyB>	FoLCs were immediately enthusiastic about the idea, and Leanne and Pam Jernigan came up with 28 categories to honor all the stories that had been posted from 1994-1997. 
2023-04-30 22:08:22 <KathyB>	As you can imagine, competition was incredibly fierce, with hundreds of amazing stories up for nomination and voting! Once the votes were tallied, an award ceremony was held on IRC, with over 70 FoLCs in attendance.
2023-04-30 22:08:28 *	Blueowl_ (Mibbit@496E62E.29FD92D1.E449F2C6.IP) has joined
2023-04-30 22:08:48 <KathyB>	With the popularity of the Kerth Awards obvious, and with a desire to make it an annual event, a new Kerth Committee was formed for year two, with Erin Klingler taking the helm, joined by Pam and myself. 
2023-04-30 22:08:54 <KathyB>	I cannot overstate how amazing this experience was, and over the next six years, from 1999-2005, we had a wonderful time celebrating all the high quality fanfic the fans of Lois & Clark have graced the fandom with.
2023-04-30 22:09:05 <KathyB>	The committee has evolved over the years, with new coordinators, quiz masters, and presenters volunteering their time. 
2023-04-30 22:09:24 <KathyB>	So please join me in giving a huge thank you to all of our past committee members who have helped over the years -- Erin, Pam, Annette, Helene, Yvonne, Wendy, Tricia, KathyM, Felicia, Vicki, and Val 
2023-04-30 22:09:32 <KathyB>	‚Äì and a just as huge welcome to our newest KComm members ‚Äì Sara, Michael, Sara, and Annie! Not to mention the many, many FoLCs who have presented awards, created videos and fanart, nominated stories, and of course, voted for their favorites.
2023-04-30 22:09:45 <KathyB>	Thank you all for making the Lois & Clark fandom still a wonderful place to be, even after 30 years! :D

2023-04-30 22:10:30 <KathyB>	CONTRACTION!!!
2023-04-30 22:10:48 <KathyB>	No, no, not this year! Fortunately my Kerth baby is all grown up ‚Äì 22 years old this year! ‚Äì and my concerns about going into labor will never disrupt another Kerth Awards. üòÑ
2023-04-30 22:10:49 *	KSaraSara eyes Kathy warily...
2023-04-30 22:11:13 <KathyB>	(Now watch, years from now, one of my kids will be having a kid, and they will go into labor on Kerth day. Ha!)

2023-04-30 22:11:46 <KathyB>	So without further adieu, on with the show!
2023-04-30 22:11:53 <KathyB>	Today we‚Äôll be presenting Kerth awards in 16 categories. We will present 8 awards, then take a 15 minute intermission, before returning to present the remaining 8 awards.
2023-04-30 22:12:04 <KathyB>	Hopefully you are all seeing this in #kerthawards, but only presenters will be able to speak here. All discussion will take place in #kerthchat, so if you haven‚Äôt already joined that channel, please do so now! It‚Äôs always a ton of fun to celebrate with your fellow FoLCs. ÔÅä 
2023-04-30 22:12:06 <KathyB>	:)
2023-04-30 22:12:21 <KathyB>	A special thank you to Doranwen, who will be our voice jockey for the ceremony. She will be muting and unmuting those who are ‚Äúat the podium‚Äù, so presenters and award winners, please make sure you are unmuted before you start talking.

2023-04-30 22:12:46 <KathyB>	Also, presenters, please check for a private message from DarthMichael during your speech, as he will be passing you the envelope with the winner‚Äôs name!
2023-04-30 22:13:07 <KathyB>	And now, to present our first category, Best Super-Short Story, is the wonderful AnnieM. Come on up, Annie!
2023-04-30 22:13:19 <AnnieM>	Thank you, Kathy!
2023-04-30 22:13:36 <AnnieM>	As an author known for her brevity, I was the obvious choice to present the Super-Short Story category
2023-04-30 22:13:46 <AnnieM>	What's that? I can't hear over all the laughter....
2023-04-30 22:14:14 <AnnieM>	Ok, seriously, as someone whose writing is anything but concise, I'm constantly amazed by how these authors can convey so much in these tiny bite-sized stories
2023-04-30 22:14:55 <AnnieM>	These stories are only 1-10kb, they still manage to make us laugh, cry and awwwww
2023-04-30 22:15:03 <AnnieM>	This year's nominees for the Super-Short category are...
2023-04-30 22:15:18 <AnnieM>	Astrologically Challenged by Anna B the Greek 
2023-04-30 22:15:24 <AnnieM>	A Family Tradition by lovetvfan

2023-04-30 22:17:39 <KathyB>	And now, to present the award for Best Original or Supporting Character, I give you our newest KComm Technical Coordinator, DarthMichael! 
2023-04-30 22:18:07 *	Darth_Michael enters from the left and jogs up to the podium.
2023-04-30 22:18:13 <Darth_Michael>	Thank you, Kathy, thank you!
2023-04-30 22:18:18 <Darth_Michael>	It‚Äôs a pleasure to be back up here after‚Ä¶umm‚Ä¶yeah, let‚Äôs just say, it‚Äôs a pleasure to be back here now.
2023-04-30 22:18:25 <Darth_Michael>	25 years of awards, can you imagine?
2023-04-30 22:18:30 <Darth_Michael>	And 30 years of LnC entrancing this fandom.
2023-04-30 22:18:36 <Darth_Michael>	Entrancing us before we even knew that there was a fandom.
2023-04-30 22:18:42 <Darth_Michael>	Actually, before we even knew that there was an Internet to have a fandom in. 
2023-04-30 22:18:48 <Darth_Michael>	Anyone watching Young Sheldon and its glorious throwbacks to the early nineties? 
2023-04-30 22:18:53 <Darth_Michael>	Back then, you had to pen and paper everything unless you were really geeky and nerdy all rolled in one. 
2023-04-30 22:19:05 *	Darth_Michael glances at thick stack of notes
2023-04-30 22:19:11 <Darth_Michael>	Oh, okay, apparently, I‚Äôm not here to talk about best *long* story, just about the characters that make those stories go on and on and on.
2023-04-30 22:19:21 *	Darth_Michael glances into audience room
2023-04-30 22:19:25 <Darth_Michael>	Just kidding!
2023-04-30 22:19:27 <Darth_Michael>	I did know why I was up here.
2023-04-30 22:19:31 <Darth_Michael>	I may take just as long as GRRM to get the next story out, but I *am* still a bit younger.
2023-04-30 22:19:34 <Darth_Michael>	And a lot less evil to my lead characters. 
2023-04-30 22:19:38 <Darth_Michael>	No, really!
2023-04-30 22:19:41 <Darth_Michael>	Mine always come back.
2023-04-30 22:19:44 <Darth_Michael>	Alive, I mean. Not pre-deceased.
2023-04-30 22:19:47 *	Darth_Michael ducks thrown Clarkie bear
2023-04-30 22:19:49 <Darth_Michael>	Hey, no attacking the presenter. We‚Äôre not at the Oscars!
2023-04-30 22:20:01 <Darth_Michael>	Where was I‚Ä¶
2023-04-30 22:20:05 *	Darth_Michael flips through pages
2023-04-30 22:20:09 <Darth_Michael>	Ah yes. The Best Original or Supporting Character in a Lois and Clark fic.
2023-04-30 22:20:13 <Darth_Michael>	Which means this category is *not* about Clark. 
2023-04-30 22:20:19 *	Darth_Michael glances back into audience
2023-04-30 22:20:23 <Darth_Michael>	Usher, could you please help that irate Clois to the foyer?
2023-04-30 22:20:25 <Darth_Michael>	Thanks.
2023-04-30 22:20:33 <Darth_Michael>	Sorry for the interruption, guys.
2023-04-30 22:20:36 <Darth_Michael>	As I was saying, this category is not about how Clark *and* Lois fare in their stories.
2023-04-30 22:20:41 <Darth_Michael>	Instead, it‚Äôs about all the other speaking roles who make up the world where our hero and heroine struggle to find their happiness. 
2023-04-30 22:20:47 *	Darth_Michael pulls out a doggie treat and throws it to the right of the audience chamber where Bakasi is sitting with her guest.
2023-04-30 22:20:51 <Darth_Michael>	Yes, Houdini. You too. 
2023-04-30 22:20:55 *	Darth_Michael gazes over crowd and waves at Selina sitting in the fourth row next to Bruce.
2023-04-30 22:20:59 <Darth_Michael>	What?
2023-04-30 22:20:59 <Darth_Michael>	No, I‚Äôm not really a dog person.
2023-04-30 22:20:59 <Darth_Michael>	I know, right?
2023-04-30 22:21:04 <Darth_Michael>	Still, I can apricate an adorably done dog like the next FoLC.
2023-04-30 22:21:07 <Darth_Michael>	And Bakasi did a truly marvelous job.
2023-04-30 22:21:11 <Darth_Michael>	She didn‚Äôt even need a Zelig Stone for it.
2023-04-30 22:21:15 <Darth_Michael>	Speaking of dogs, who would have guessed that *Claude* would make the list?
2023-04-30 22:21:18 *	Darth_Michael points back at audience
2023-04-30 22:21:20 <Darth_Michael>	*Lois*, please stop hitting the Frenchman with your purse. You‚Äôve seen what happened to Clois.
2023-04-30 22:21:26 <Darth_Michael>	Sorry, again. Tonight‚Äôs audience is much more unruly than it was in the early years. 
2023-04-30 22:21:31 <Darth_Michael>	At least no one‚Äôs gone into labor yet, though, right?
2023-04-30 22:21:38 *	Darth_Michael waits for chuckling to die down
2023-04-30 22:21:50 <Darth_Michael>	So, aside from various canines, both cute and stray ones, we also got characters of the feline persuasion this year.
2023-04-30 22:21:57 *	Darth_Michael continues quickly before Cat can discuss with Selina how to best leave permanent markings on presenter‚Äôs hide
2023-04-30 22:22:02 <Darth_Michael>	Speaking of cuteness‚Ä¶we also got the next generation of characters represented with Hannah, who doesn‚Äôt even have to pretend to be her mother‚Äôs favorite accomplishment.
2023-04-30 22:22:08 <Darth_Michael>	Which leads us to Clark‚Äôs mom. 
2023-04-30 22:22:11 <Darth_Michael>	Martha is such a Lois and Clark staple, that it‚Äôs both a wonder she‚Äôs not mentioned more often in this category and at the same time, a sign of just how supportive she was of Lois to make the list.
2023-04-30 22:22:16 *	Darth_Michael takes a breath while checking the notes
2023-04-30 22:22:22 <Darth_Michael>	Ah, yes, and who could forget Lana?
2023-04-30 22:22:26 *	Darth_Michael watches as Clark catches the small tray sailing off from their table towards his high school sweetheart
2023-04-30 22:22:31 *	Darth_Michael clears throat
2023-04-30 22:22:37 <Darth_Michael>	Apparently, certainly not Lois.
2023-04-30 22:22:41 <Darth_Michael>	Good thing we didn‚Äôt need Henderson to arrest our intrepid reporter for assault this early into the evening.
2023-04-30 22:22:47 *	Darth_Michael gives an embarrassed smile
2023-04-30 22:22:50 <Darth_Michael>	Whoever thought of actually inviting all those characters to the party would be a good idea, needs to have their good senses checked.
2023-04-30 22:22:53 <Darth_Michael>	Too bad Dr. Deter isn‚Äôt here. 
2023-04-30 22:22:56 <Darth_Michael>	Or Tempus.
2023-04-30 22:22:58 <Darth_Michael>	Can you imagine his laughter at the irony of Lois getting hauled out of a Kerth ceremony, kicking and screaming, when she wasn‚Äôt even nominated herself?
2023-04-30 22:23:09 <Darth_Michael>	Which brings us to the actual list of nominees:
2023-04-30 22:23:17 <Darth_Michael>	Henderson: Aftershocks by Toomi8
2023-04-30 22:23:17 <Darth_Michael>	Cat Grant: Bad Reputation by Deadly Chakram

2023-04-30 22:23:35 <Darth_Michael>	And the winner is‚Ä¶

2023-04-30 22:23:52 <Darth_Michael>	Congratulations you guys!
2023-04-30 22:24:16 <AnnieM>	Awww, thank you so much, y'all!
2023-04-30 22:24:53 <AnnieM>	I have to say, this Lana is one of my favorite characters I have ever written. I was nervous about how she'd be received by the fandom, since I know she's usually a character we love to hate.
2023-04-30 22:25:08 <AnnieM>	So it means a lot that you gave her a chance and learned to love her as much as we do
2023-04-30 22:26:02 <KathyB>	Yes, thank you, everyone! I give all the credit in the world to Annie, who did the vast majority of the writing, and gave me the wonderful gift of being the peanut gallery :)
2023-04-30 22:26:36 <KathyB>	This was the most fun I've had working on a story since ... well, since the last time Annie and I wrote a story together, LOL!
2023-04-30 22:26:54 <AnnieM>	LOL! I will absolutely second that. Working together is always a joy.
2023-04-30 22:27:43 *	KathyB puts my MC hat back on
2023-04-30 22:28:00 <KathyB>	And now, to present the award for Best Kiss, please welcome AnnaBtG!

2023-04-30 22:30:10 <AnnaBtG>	Well, then. Tonight, I‚Äôm going to talk to you about a problem most Lois and Clark writers have encountered.
2023-04-30 22:30:37 <AnnaBtG>	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/jIwL0IT6
2023-04-30 22:31:04 <AnnaBtG>	Hmm... *taps microphone*
2023-04-30 22:31:12 <AnnaBtG>	This was not planned, I promise.
2023-04-30 22:31:58 <AnnaBtG>	Also, this is not the problem I was referring to.
2023-04-30 22:32:30 <AnnaBtG>	That problem is:
2023-04-30 22:32:35 <AnnaBtG>	Lois and Clark are in love, as you very well know, no matter how hard Lois tries to deny it. And not only are they in love, but they are also super attracted to each other.
2023-04-30 22:33:07 <AnnaBtG>	Which, good for them, but it causes a certain problem for the writer.
2023-04-30 22:33:24 <AnnaBtG>	You see, they want to kiss. A lot.
2023-04-30 22:33:37 <AnnaBtG>	Have you ever tried to write a kiss? It‚Äôs damn hard, let me tell you.
2023-04-30 22:33:52 <AnnaBtG>	There are feelings and sensations and positions and body parts to consider.
2023-04-30 22:34:07 <AnnaBtG>	And while Lois and Clark are having fun making out and most of the time not stopping for the world, on the other side of the page there‚Äôs a writer wanting to gouge their eyes out with cringe at their own words, or begging them to stop so they can get on with the plot.
2023-04-30 22:34:37 <AnnaBtG>	They persist, though ‚Äì and how happy are we that they do!
2023-04-30 22:34:49 <AnnaBtG>	Because we get some great stories out of it! 
2023-04-30 22:35:04 <AnnaBtG>	Whether a kiss is the whole point of the fic, or a small part in a longer journey, it definitely spices up a story and gives us some much-desired feels, which is precisely what we‚Äôre here for!
2023-04-30 22:35:22 <AnnaBtG>	So here‚Äôs the list of the stories with the most memorable kisses of the year!
2023-04-30 22:35:58 <AnnaBtG>	Kiss Me by SuperBek
2023-04-30 22:36:10 <AnnaBtG>	Ficathon: Kiss Me (for Carrie Rene) by lovetvfan
2023-04-30 22:36:21 <AnnaBtG>	This Is Not A Date by KSaraSara
2023-04-30 22:36:35 <AnnaBtG>	What the Heart Wants by AnnieM and KathyB
2023-04-30 22:36:49 <AnnaBtG>	Yours to Discover (for Queen of the Capes) by KSaraSara
2023-04-30 22:37:02 <AnnaBtG>	And the winner is‚Ä¶
2023-04-30 22:37:40 <AnnaBtG>	What the Heart Wants by AnnieM and KathyB!!! Congrats!!
2023-04-30 22:39:25 *	Voice_Jockey removes voice from AnnaBtG
2023-04-30 22:40:14 <AnnieM>	I don't even know what to say, given that I was just in the chat lamenting how hard it is to write kisses and how I'm always sure they are so bad no one will ever believe I've actually experienced a kiss. It just goes to show that these characters have such awesome chemistry, the kisses practically write themselves.
2023-04-30 22:40:24 <AnnieM>	Thank you all so much!
2023-04-30 22:40:53 <KathyB>	Thank you, everyone! As I just said in chat, I was already planning to reread the story this week, and now I have to pay special attention to those kisses. :D
2023-04-30 22:41:39 *	KathyB stops Annie from leaving the stage
2023-04-30 22:42:03 <KathyB>	Because in a perfect transition, up now to present the award for Best Short Story, please welcome back our newest KComm Volunteer Coordinator, the wonderful AnnieM!
2023-04-30 22:42:20 <AnnieM>	Ah yes, Best Short Story...
2023-04-30 22:42:26 <AnnieM>	As an author known for her brevity....
2023-04-30 22:42:35 *	Meadowlark has quit (Quit: https://mibbit.com Online IRC Client)
2023-04-30 22:42:36 <AnnieM>	Wait a minute, that sounds familiar ;)
2023-04-30 22:42:49 <AnnieM>	The short story category is for stories that clock in at 11-50kb. That‚Äôs the perfect sweet spot for a story you can sink your teeth into but still read in a single sitting. 
2023-04-30 22:43:02 <AnnieM>	As a reader, these are my favorite stories to return to again and again. The perfect pick-me-up after a long day or the perfect bedtime story after a long night. 
2023-04-30 22:43:17 <AnnieM>	And as a writer, I‚Äôm endlessly impressed by authors who can tell a whole story and capture such an impressive depth of emotion in so few words. They are more than just a single scene ‚Äì they manage to cram all the drama and angst and excitement of a full-length story into just 11-50kb.
2023-04-30 22:43:36 <AnnieM>	This year‚Äôs nominees for Best Short Story are:
2023-04-30 22:43:43 <AnnieM>	Drinks After Work by KSaraSara
2023-04-30 22:43:50 <AnnieM>	Footprint Hotel by Blueowl
2023-04-30 22:43:58 <AnnieM>	Pencil It In by SuperBek
2023-04-30 22:44:06 <AnnieM>	Pheromone, My Love by KSaraSara
2023-04-30 22:44:18 <AnnieM>	Rainfall by Morgana
2023-04-30 22:44:22 <AnnieM>	And the winner is....
2023-04-30 22:44:42 <AnnieM>	Pencil It In by SuperBek
2023-04-30 22:44:46 *	Voice_Jockey gives voice to Bek
2023-04-30 22:44:47 <AnnieM>	Congratulations!
2023-04-30 22:45:07 *	Meadowlark (Mibbit@cloak-C85C35F7.mobile.att.net) has joined
2023-04-30 22:45:13 <Bek>	Oh my, goodness! Um, thank you! 
2023-04-30 22:47:08 <Bek>	I don't know what to say! I loved writing this story, even though writing the longer stories is really my favorite :) I'm so glad it was well received! Thank you all so much!
2023-04-30 22:48:08 <KathyB>	Congratulations :)
2023-04-30 22:48:20 <KathyB>	 And now, we have a special treat. In lieu of a Best New Author award, we‚Äôve decided to highlight both authors that graced us with their first stories in 2022. To present the first of those highlights, please welcome our newest Kerth Coordinator, KSaraSara!
2023-04-30 22:48:24 *	Voice_Jockey removes voice from Bek
2023-04-30 22:49:18 *	KSaraSara steps up to the mic... knowing she's going to flub the pasting...
2023-04-30 22:49:27 <KSaraSara>	As a 30-year-old fandom, I think it‚Äôs pretty phenomenal that, year after year, we keep gaining new authors! (Okay, so I didn‚Äôt fact check that there were new authors EVERY year...but I‚Äôm fairly certain.)
2023-04-30 22:49:48 <KSaraSara>	Our first of two authors to celebrate tonight is Jerseygrl! Hailing to us from the Superman & Lois fandom, she debuted as a writer in our L&C fandom last year. 
2023-04-30 22:50:08 <KSaraSara>	To give you a little taste of her writing and entice you to read her fantastic first L&C fic, here‚Äôs a spoiler-free excerpt from her story, ‚ÄúThe Card‚Äù:
2023-04-30 22:50:44 <KSaraSara>	(Summary: At the end of Tempus Fugitive, right before they return to their time and their memories are wiped, Lois writes herself a note on the back of Perry‚Äôs birthday card so she won‚Äôt forget that Clark is Superman...)
2023-04-30 22:50:44 <KSaraSara>	(Summary: At the end of Tempus Fugitive, right before they return to their time and their memories are wiped, Lois writes herself a note on the back of Perry‚Äôs birthday card so she won‚Äôt forget that Clark is Superman...)
2023-04-30 22:50:44 <KSaraSara>	(Summary: At the end of Tempus Fugitive, right before they return to their time and their memories are wiped, Lois writes herself a note on the back of Perry‚Äôs birthday card so she won‚Äôt forget that Clark is Superman...)
2023-04-30 22:50:46 <KSaraSara>	Summary: At the end of Tempus Fugitive, right before they return to their time and their memories are wiped, Lois writes herself a note on the back of Perry‚Äôs birthday card so she won‚Äôt forget that Clark is Superman...
2023-04-30 22:51:10 <KSaraSara>	***** ‚ÄúFor god‚Äôs sake, Lois, wouldn‚Äôt hurt you to knock,‚Äù he said. 
2023-04-30 22:51:10 <KSaraSara>	‚ÄúNo time, chief,‚Äù she replied, tossing the present at his desk. He picked it up, contemplating it for a moment. 
2023-04-30 22:51:10 <KSaraSara>	***** ‚ÄúFor god‚Äôs sake, Lois, wouldn‚Äôt hurt you to knock,‚Äù he said.
2023-04-30 22:51:18 <KSaraSara>	‚ÄúNo time, chief,‚Äù she replied, tossing the present at his desk. He picked it up, contemplating it for a moment.
2023-04-30 22:51:28 <KSaraSara>	‚ÄúOh, and here,‚Äù she added, dropping the card right beside it. ‚ÄúHappy birthday, or whatever...‚Äù
2023-04-30 22:51:49 <KSaraSara>	She saw Clark approaching from behind and she rolled her eyes, noticing Perry finally picking up the card as she started to turn away. He held it up, jamming his finger under the glued flap, and then he started to tear it open‚Äî
2023-04-30 22:52:04 <KSaraSara>	And that‚Äôs when she saw it. 
2023-04-30 22:52:04 <KSaraSara>	Or she thought she did...
2023-04-30 22:52:04 <KSaraSara>	And that‚Äôs when she saw it.
2023-04-30 22:52:10 <KSaraSara>	Or she thought she did...
2023-04-30 22:52:18 <KSaraSara>	But it had to have been her imagination. It had to have said something else...
2023-04-30 22:52:26 <KSaraSara>	She pivoted back around violently, smacking her shoulder into Clark in the process, and then she narrowed her eyes as Perry finally finished opening the envelope.
2023-04-30 22:53:10 <KSaraSara>	‚ÄúWell, isn‚Äôt this lovely,‚Äù he said as he pulled the card out. ‚ÄúAn empty card! No signature or anything! Well thank you, Lois... I guess...‚Äù
2023-04-30 22:53:20 <KSaraSara>	‚ÄúThe present, chief, why don‚Äôt you open the present,‚Äù Clark said, trying to cover for her neglectful mishap.
2023-04-30 22:53:28 <KSaraSara>	But Lois could barely hear what was going on around her. It was completely insignificant‚Äù especially in light of what she had just seen...
2023-04-30 22:53:36 <KSaraSara>	Or thought she had seen.
2023-04-30 22:53:45 <KSaraSara>	‚ÄúAh, good idea, Kent,‚Äù Perry said. ‚ÄúNow, Lois, I can‚Äôt wait to see what you bought this year. Your gifts are always so... thoughtful.‚Äù
2023-04-30 22:53:55 <KSaraSara>	She had misread it. Clearly she had misread it. 
2023-04-30 22:53:55 <KSaraSara>	The envelope was now flat on the desk, those pesky, mysterious words hidden from view.
2023-04-30 22:54:02 <KSaraSara>	The words she had imagined, clearly. It was wishful thinking‚Äù  *****
2023-04-30 22:54:22 <KSaraSara>	Ack!! She actually saw the envelope! What‚Äôs she going to do about it??
2023-04-30 22:54:35 <KSaraSara>	You can check out the full story on the MBs, the archive, or AO3! While Jerseygrl has only given us one L&C story so far, we sure hope she‚Äôll give us more in the time to come! Welcome to the fandom, Jerseygrl, and thank you for sharing your gift of 
2023-04-30 22:54:35 <KSaraSara>	Writing!!
2023-04-30 22:54:51 *	Voice_Jockey gives voice to AnnaBtG
2023-04-30 22:55:09 <KathyB>	Thank you, Sara, and thank you, Jerseygrl, for joining the addictive world of L&C fanfic! 
2023-04-30 22:55:15 <KathyB>	And now, to present the award for Best Challenge Response, we welcome back AnnaBtG.
2023-04-30 22:55:58 <AnnaBtG>	This category, fellas.
2023-04-30 22:56:14 <AnnaBtG>	The first thing I did after I submitted my vote was to go on Discord and complain that this category was *the worst* because I wanted to vote all of the stories!!!
2023-04-30 22:56:47 <AnnaBtG>	Every single one of them is an absolute gem!
2023-04-30 22:57:09 <AnnaBtG>	We have:
2023-04-30 22:57:12 <AnnaBtG>	Ficathon: Beyond Closed Doors (for KSaraSara) by bakasi, in which we get the front seat on Lois‚Äôs regret after slamming the door on Clark‚Äôs face, and her growing anxiety and worry after she can‚Äôt find him at work or at home the next day. A fic full of feels!
2023-04-30 22:57:31 <AnnaBtG>	Ficathon: Evening of Mishaps (for bakasi) by Toomi8, in which we discover that Clark without his powers is a klutz who can‚Äôt stop hurting himself! You can‚Äôt help but feel for him even as you laugh at his misfortune!
2023-04-30 22:57:51 <AnnaBtG>	Footprint Hotel by Blueowl, in which pre-Superman Clark Kent leaves his literal mark at a small place and helps them in a different way than usual. A lovely exploration of what Superman means to and can do for the world!
2023-04-30 22:58:10 <AnnaBtG>	Ficathon: Kiss Me (for Carrie Rene) by lovetvfan, in which Lois and Clark go to Smallville in pursuit of a human interest story‚Ä¶ and an elusive date! A sweet, heartwarming story, with a hearty dose of small town quaintness and nostalgia!
2023-04-30 22:58:31 <AnnaBtG>	Open All Night - 2022 Kerth Challenge #4 by lovetvfan, in which Lois navigates her fear of loss after losing Clark almost forever, and Clark tries to balance out his own fears with his need to love and comfort Lois. A beautiful, emotional post-TOGOM story to the tune of my beloved Bon Jovi!
2023-04-30 22:58:51 <AnnaBtG>	Yours to Discover (for Queen of the Capes) by KSaraSara, in which we explore Canada with Lois and Clark when they travel there for a journalism conference, in a trip that turns out to pack more than Clark had predicted! Fun and lightheartedly
2023-04-30 22:59:05 <AnnaBtG>	suspenseful at the same time!
2023-04-30 22:59:20 <AnnaBtG>	A magnificent collection of stories, and believe me when I tell you, I will be equally happy no matter which one wins, because they‚Äôre all favorites!
2023-04-30 22:59:33 <AnnaBtG>	Nevertheless, the winner is‚Ä¶
2023-04-30 23:00:13 <AnnaBtG>	Footprint Hotel by Blueowl!! Congratulations!!!

2023-04-30 23:01:11 <Blueowl_>	Thank you! I loved writing this fic, especially since it was very different from what I typically write. I'm so glad everyone enjoyed it. Thank you!

2023-04-30 23:02:17 <KathyB>	And now, to present the award for Best Revelation, please welcome our newest KComm Activities Coordinator, Sara aka lovetvfan, who sent us her speech ahead of time to paste for her.
2023-04-30 23:02:52 <lovetvfan_sock>	Best Revelation Story ‚Äì These are stories that focus on‚Ä¶well, the revelation of a secret.
2023-04-30 23:02:56 <lovetvfan_sock>	A certain secret.
2023-04-30 23:03:02 <lovetvfan_sock>	A specific one actually.
2023-04-30 23:03:05 <lovetvfan_sock>	And I‚Äôll be honest, it‚Äôs a pretty big secret.
2023-04-30 23:03:10 <lovetvfan_sock>	Like‚Ä¶I dunno if anyone else knew this, but did you guys know that Clark Kent is actually‚Ä¶a Toronto Maple Leafs fan? 
2023-04-30 23:03:17 <lovetvfan_sock>	I KNOW! I was floored! I mean, of all the hockey teams to root for, he goes and picks a team that hasn‚Äôt won a Stanley Cup since 1967!
2023-04-30 23:03:25 <lovetvfan_sock>	I mean he was only a year old for crying out loud! Now I can‚Äôt wrap my head around why this revelation garners this much fanfic but I‚Ä¶
2023-04-30 23:03:29 <lovetvfan_sock>	*checks notes* 
2023-04-30 23:03:34 <lovetvfan_sock>	No, wait, sorry my bad. 
2023-04-30 23:03:39 <lovetvfan_sock>	Best Revelation is a category that focuses on the various ways in which Clark Kent reveals to Lois Lane that he is Superman!
2023-04-30 23:03:42 <lovetvfan_sock>	Whoops!
2023-04-30 23:03:46 <lovetvfan_sock>	Sorry about that.
2023-04-30 23:03:49 <lovetvfan_sock>	It‚Äôs playoff season.
2023-04-30 23:03:51 <lovetvfan_sock>	Easy mistake to make, right? 
2023-04-30 23:04:01 <lovetvfan_sock>	Either way‚Ä¶the nominees are: 
2023-04-30 23:04:06 <lovetvfan_sock>	Drinks After Work by KSaraSara
2023-04-30 23:04:12 <lovetvfan_sock>	Kiss Me by SuperBek

2023-04-30 23:04:41 <lovetvfan_sock>	Congratulations you two!
2023-04-30 23:04:54 *	Voice_Jockey removes voice from lovetvfan_sock
2023-04-30 23:05:13 <AnnieM>	Thanks so much, everyone! This revelation was truly a new one for me -- how do you write a revelation in a world where there is no Superman?
2023-04-30 23:06:02 <AnnieM>	It was so different from any of the other dozens of revelations I've written over the decades, and I'm so glad the readers appreciated it!
2023-04-30 23:07:52 <KathyB>	Yes, thank you everyone. I have to admit, as much as I love everything about this story, the revelation -- both of them -- is the section that is my ultimate favorite in the whole story.
2023-04-30 23:07:54 <KathyB>	So thank you!
2023-04-30 23:08:22 <KathyB>	And now, to present the award for Best Mid-Length Story, welcome back Michael!
2023-04-30 23:08:29 *	Darth_Michael comes back up to the stage
2023-04-30 23:08:34 <Darth_Michael>	Wow, can you believe that? 
2023-04-30 23:08:36 <Darth_Michael>	Clark Kent is Superman!
2023-04-30 23:08:39 <Darth_Michael>	Judas Priest‚Ä¶
2023-04-30 23:08:41 <Darth_Michael>	Next thing you‚Äôll tell me, Lois Lane is actually Ultra Woman!
2023-04-30 23:08:43 <Darth_Michael>	Then again, it would explain her stout refusal to die no matter how many nefarious plots and dangerous haircuts she was subjected to over the years.
2023-04-30 23:08:54 <Darth_Michael>	Aaaanyhow, speaking on the subject of Lois‚Äôs love affair with dangerous situations, I just realized something:
2023-04-30 23:08:58 <Darth_Michael>	This category, which is so graciously called ‚ÄúBest Mid-Length Story‚Äù, should really be called ‚ÄúBest Date Story‚Äù this year.
2023-04-30 23:09:02 <Darth_Michael>	No, seriously, there‚Äôs four stories that are literally just a date and one that‚Äôs basically a date and its consequences.
2023-04-30 23:09:08 <Darth_Michael>	You can‚Äôt make that stuff up if you tried.
2023-04-30 23:09:14 <Darth_Michael>	And in years past, FoLCs did try to make that stuff up.
2023-04-30 23:09:17 <Darth_Michael>	A lot.
2023-04-30 23:09:23 <Darth_Michael>	So, Best Mid-Length Story, that‚Äôs anything from what KSaraSara calls a vignette to what the rest of us old timers‚Ä¶
2023-04-30 23:09:28 *	Darth_Michael eyes registration date
2023-04-30 23:09:31 <Darth_Michael>	(Yes, I‚Äôll stick with ‚Äúus‚Äù.)
2023-04-30 23:09:34 <Darth_Michael>	‚Ä¶calls one post a week for a month.
2023-04-30 23:09:39 <Darth_Michael>	Man, those were the times when an entire plot was done as a tragedy in four parts. 
2023-04-30 23:09:41 *	Darth_Michael listens to earwig
2023-04-30 23:09:44 <Darth_Michael>	Oh, yeah, sorry, we also had ‚Äúdate‚Äù stories in years past, too.
2023-04-30 23:09:48 <Darth_Michael>	There was one where Lois helped Clark get ready for a date with a mystery woman.
2023-04-30 23:09:52 <Darth_Michael>	Lucy playing a matchmaking Santa.
2023-04-30 23:09:55 <Darth_Michael>	Does Lois and Clark kissing for three parts straight on the top of her future Jeep‚Äôs hood count as a date?
2023-04-30 23:10:02 <Darth_Michael>	But we‚Äôre not here to honor those stories of Kerths past.
2023-04-30 23:10:08 <Darth_Michael>	Noooo‚Ä¶
2023-04-30 23:10:12 <Darth_Michael>	We‚Äôre here to honor this latest crop of stories about Lois and Clark being horny reporters working up the nerve to share a kiss, cause WAFFy feelings, and general comedic merriment.
2023-04-30 23:10:18 *	Darth_Michael listens again to earwig
2023-04-30 23:10:21 <Darth_Michael>	Okay, fine, I do realize that these are their own categories.
2023-04-30 23:10:25 <Darth_Michael>	I do pay attention, you know?
2023-04-30 23:10:29 <Darth_Michael>	Sorry about that, guys. 
2023-04-30 23:10:35 <Darth_Michael>	I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all had this happen to you, plotting along, and then your friendly neighborhood Beta interjects with ‚Äúthey wouldn‚Äôt do that‚Äù or ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do that‚Äù.
2023-04-30 23:10:41 <Darth_Michael>	And‚Ä¶surprise‚Ä¶the Beta is usually right, too.
2023-04-30 23:10:52 <Darth_Michael>	So, without much fanfare and in order to prevent the ushers from dragging me off the stage for going way too far off script, I give you this year‚Äôs nominees for the Best Mid-Length Story!
2023-04-30 23:11:01 <Darth_Michael>	Frankly My Dear, I Don't Like Pearl Jam by lovetvfan and KSaraSara

2023-04-30 23:11:01 <Darth_Michael>	Yours to Discover (for Queen of the Capes) by KSaraSara
2023-04-30 23:11:05 *	Darth_Michael waits for audience to erupt in applause
2023-04-30 23:11:10 <Darth_Michael>	What?
2023-04-30 23:11:12 <Darth_Michael>	Why are you not surprised?
2023-04-30 23:11:23 *	Darth_Michael listens once again to earwig
2023-04-30 23:11:26 <Darth_Michael>	Oh, yeah, sorry. 
2023-04-30 23:11:29 <Darth_Michael>	My bad. 
2023-04-30 23:11:32 <Darth_Michael>	The nominees are already very well known to everyone in attendance.
2023-04-30 23:11:36 <Darth_Michael>	Which means you‚Äôre all waiting for me to pull out another envelope, right?
2023-04-30 23:11:41 *	Darth_Michael pulls out another envelope
2023-04-30 23:11:45 <Darth_Michael>	And now, with very much fanfare‚Ä¶
2023-04-30 23:11:48 *	Darth_Michael slips open the envelope and peeks inside
2023-04-30 23:11:51 <Darth_Michael>	Yep.
2023-04-30 23:11:54 <Darth_Michael>	The winners are a tie! The first TIE of the evening!
2023-04-30 23:11:57 *	Darth_Michael ducks from strafing run
2023-04-30 23:12:03 <Darth_Michael>	Ahem, sorry about that... 
2023-04-30 23:12:07 <Darth_Michael>	Wrong fandom...
2023-04-30 23:12:11 <Darth_Michael>	So, I'm happy to congratulate...
2023-04-30 23:12:16 <Darth_Michael>	Frankly My Dear, I Don't Like Pearl Jam by lovetvfan and KSaraSara
2023-04-30 23:12:16 <Darth_Michael>	In the Right Now by AnnieM
2023-04-30 23:12:22 <Darth_Michael>	Congratulations! You've written such wonderful stories.
2023-04-30 23:12:47 *	Darth_Michael steps back to welcome back Annie & Sara
2023-04-30 23:13:06 <KSaraSara>	Uh... Annie can go first! lol
2023-04-30 23:13:16 <AnnieM>	LOL
2023-04-30 23:13:20 <AnnieM>	Well, first, it's such an honor to share this award with a story I loved so much! 
2023-04-30 23:14:00 <AnnieM>	And second, I'm so thrilled for this little abandoned cabin story! I wrote 90% of it, abandoned it for WTHW and forgot all about it, languishing on my harddrive
2023-04-30 23:14:34 <AnnieM>	Then I finally finished it, and by the time Kerth season rolled around, I had forgotten all about it again. Well, not forgotten really, but I thought it had been eligible last year and totally wasn't thinking about it at all
2023-04-30 23:15:14 <AnnieM>	I was shocked to see it nominated for awards, and I'm so thrilled for it to have won honor. It's my little story that could. It just refused to give up. So thanks everyone for remembering it!
2023-04-30 23:16:45 <KSaraSara>	Gahhh okay... my turn, I think!
2023-04-30 23:16:53 <KSaraSara>	Oh wow! I love that my first Kerth and Sara's first Kerth is for something we wrote together!! And I'm know she's wishing she could be here now! When we wrote our first story together (Love Me Back To Life), we never dreamed we'd write so well together and have so much fun! So when she approached me about a second idea... it went something like this...
2023-04-30 23:17:28 <KSaraSara>	Sara: I have an idea for our next story. We write the first date as if they actually went to the Pearl Jam concert.
2023-04-30 23:17:28 <KSaraSara>	Me: ... I don't like Pearl Jam and that sounds boring.
2023-04-30 23:17:45 <KSaraSara>	Sara: But... it'll be fun, trust me! Just think...
2023-04-30 23:18:14 <KSaraSara>	And it went on and on... she spent probably a good straight 10 mins in chat trying to convince me. And I RELUCTANTLY agreed!
2023-04-30 23:18:51 <KSaraSara>	But oh boy was I wrong because this was so amazing and such a joy to write! (Other than the Pearl Jam I made myself listen to lol)
2023-04-30 23:19:43 <KSaraSara>	Thank you to my Twinnie and partner in crime for being right and not giving up! And thank you to everyone who read and commented and enjoyed!! Thank you so much!!
2023-04-30 23:20:28 <KathyB>	Congratulations to all three authors in our first (only??) tie of the evening!
2023-04-30 23:20:56 <KathyB>	And now, for our last award before Intermission, to present the award for Best Episode Adaptation, welcome back AnnieM to the stage.
2023-04-30 23:21:26 <AnnieM>	Let‚Äôs be real for a minute‚Ä¶.we all know the writers in this fandom can write circles around the actual show writers. 
2023-04-30 23:21:39 <AnnieM>	As much as we love the show ‚Äì and clearly we do, since we are still here reading and writing about these characters 25 years later! ‚Äì there are times we love to hate it too. 
2023-04-30 23:21:49 <AnnieM>	 Or even just times we know we could have taken a great idea and made it so much better.
2023-04-30 23:22:00 <AnnieM>	This category honors the stories that do exactly that ‚Äì improve on the work of the original writers. 
2023-04-30 23:22:10 <AnnieM>	Sometimes an episode was ALMOST perfect, and the author gives it that final push by adding one little missing scene. 
2023-04-30 23:22:19 <AnnieM>	And sometimes the set up is perfect, but the author takes the story in a whole new, surprising direction. 
2023-04-30 23:22:29 <AnnieM>	These types of stories have always been among my favorite because they take those familiar moments from the screen and reimagine them on the page.
2023-04-30 23:22:39 <AnnieM>	Whether it‚Äôs a single scene or an epic tale, these stories start during a specific episode of the show and insert a scene, fix the episode, or veer off into a new universe of the author‚Äôs creation.
2023-04-30 23:22:46 <AnnieM>	This year‚Äôs nominees are‚Ä¶
2023-04-30 23:22:52 <AnnieM>	Aftershocks by Toomi8

2023-04-30 23:24:12 <Toomi>	Thank you!
2023-04-30 23:24:41 <Toomi>	This story started in a scribbler while I was at work, avoiding the snow. 
2023-04-30 23:25:26 <Toomi>	It was supposed to be a few chapters, but kept growing and growing, and I fell even more in love with the Henderson character as I wrote it.
2023-04-30 23:25:38 <Toomi>	I'm so glad you all enjoyed it :)
2023-04-30 23:26:28 *	Voice_Jockey removes voice from Toomi
2023-04-30 23:26:36 <KathyB>	Great job, Toomi, and congratulations to all the winners in the first 8 categories!
2023-04-30 23:26:40 <KathyB>	Now it's time for a brief intermission
2023-04-30 23:27:29 <KathyB>	We're going to break for 10 minutes, so whatever your time zone, add 10 minutes to the clock. So in Eastern US time, it's 5:27 pm, so we'll be back at X:37
2023-04-30 23:27:41 <KathyB>	But don‚Äôt go too far! 
2023-04-30 23:27:51 <KathyB>	Because guess what I have? 
2023-04-30 23:28:02 <KathyB>	(For you to catch up on when you return)
2023-04-30 23:28:10 <KathyB>	RETRO COMMERCIALS! AND A SONG!
2023-04-30 23:28:25 <KathyB>	When Sara asked me if I‚Äôd act as MC for tonight, I went back into my hard drive to see if I had any old Kerth ceremony files. 
2023-04-30 23:28:34 <KathyB>	And boy did I hit paydirt! 
2023-04-30 23:28:44 <KathyB>	I found a script for the 2001 Kerth Awards, and FoLCs that year wrote a variety of fun commercials for us, as well a ‚ÄúFilk‚Äù, a song with lyrics changed to an L&C theme.
2023-04-30 23:28:54 <KathyB>	So whether or not you head to the kitchen or restroom during our break, be sure to enjoy this blast from the past!

2023-04-30 23:35:16 <KathyB>	There was a note from Erin that was on display

2023-04-30 23:35:58 <KathyB>	And the fics are mounting and my time is short

2023-04-30 23:36:30 <KathyB>	I checked the quizzes just the other day
2023-04-30 23:36:35 <KathyB>	So much still to read and I'm not halfway
2023-04-30 23:36:40 <KathyB>	Nominations opened, I'm filled with dismay
2023-04-30 23:36:44 <KathyB>	My thoughts are all in great disarray
2023-04-30 23:36:49 <KathyB>	But I've got to get together

2023-04-30 23:37:52 <KathyB>	They posted nominees the other day
2023-04-30 23:37:57 <KathyB>	Such fabulous fics, might be time to pray
2023-04-30 23:38:01 <KathyB>	How to choose just one when they're all so good?
2023-04-30 23:38:06 <KathyB>	It doesn't seem like anyone could!
2023-04-30 23:38:11 <KathyB>	But the rules are clear, nothing else to be done,

2023-04-30 23:39:01 <KathyB>	Well, the Kerths are over and the fun's gone away
2023-04-30 23:39:07 <KathyB>	I logged back on just the other day
2023-04-30 23:39:12 <KathyB>	I was glad to see the archive going strong
2023-04-30 23:39:17 <KathyB>	With lots of new fics just humming along
2023-04-30 23:39:22 <KathyB>	And a warm'n'fuzzy feeling made me grin from ear to ear
2023-04-30 23:39:28 <KathyB>	Cause there'll still be Kerths next year, yeah
2023-04-30 23:39:33 <KathyB>	There's gonna be the Kerths next year
2023-04-30 23:39:40 <KathyB>	.
2023-04-30 23:39:41 <KathyB>	And as I turned off the modem it occurred to me
2023-04-30 23:39:46 <KathyB>	FoLCs are the best there can be
2023-04-30 23:39:51 <KathyB>	The very best fans to be

2023-04-30 23:41:21 <KathyB>	Wild applause for that song and the retro commercials! I love how applicable the song, especially, still is ... TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER!!
2023-04-30 23:42:22 <KathyB>	Welcome back, everyone! We‚Äôre excited to move on with the second half of our ceremony.
2023-04-30 23:42:39 <KathyB>	To present the award for Best Elseworlds/AU Story, come on up, KSaraSara!
2023-04-30 23:43:23 <KSaraSara>	Anyone who knows me (and even some who don‚Äôt, lol) knows that I‚Äôm a sucker for altClark. Yeah, yeah, there‚Äôs quite a list of things that make me go GAHHHH! But I have a special place in my heart for altClark. There‚Äôs just something about a Clark that doesn‚Äôt get his Lois in the same ‚Äúeasy‚Äù way as our canonClark does.
2023-04-30 23:43:47 <KSaraSara>	Best Elseworlds/AU honors those authors who have expanded on the alternate universe we saw on the show as well as those who have gifted us with their ability to build an entirely different universe‚Äîan elseworld. 
2023-04-30 23:44:08 <KSaraSara>	This year, our nominated stories include: altClark in yet a different universe, a Clark who is a pragmatic P.I. (in addition to Superman), a Clark who stayed in Smallville to teach English and coach football, a Clark who was abducted by Trask at a young age, and a Clark who was abducted by Trask at a young age.
2023-04-30 23:44:22 *	KSaraSara cries... Trask is so evil!
2023-04-30 23:44:31 <KSaraSara>	Needless to say, we all seem to be suckers for an alternate Clark who needs to overcome extraordinary circumstances to find his place in the world. 
2023-04-30 23:44:54 <KSaraSara>	The nominees for Best Elseworlds/AU Story are:
2023-04-30 23:45:01 <KSaraSara>	Anchor: Part 1 - Clark Kent by SuperBek

2023-04-30 23:49:00 <KSaraSara>	Congrats!!!!
2023-04-30 23:49:20 <AnnieM>	Way to swoop in with the big reveal! Amping up the drama ;)
2023-04-30 23:50:03 <KathyB>	LOL yes, and I noticed that no one actually sent me the winner, so I had no idea who it was going to be. Sara returned just in time!
2023-04-30 23:50:09 <AnnieM>	Thanks so much, everyone. This is really my favorite category for fic in general. I love love love and AU. There's something so special about taking the characters out of their element and keeping them the same. 
2023-04-30 23:50:33 <AnnieM>	Especially in this fandom, where AUs reincarnation/soulmates are canon
2023-04-30 23:51:42 <AnnieM>	I've written a few short AUs in the distant past, but this was my first attempt at a true full-length AU, and creating this world was the most fun I've had in ages. I wish you all could be privvy to the hours and hours and hours of brainstorming that Kathy and I did, all the backstory that never made it into the story
2023-04-30 23:52:35 <AnnieM>	It was truly a joy to dream up this world, and we said over and over that even if no one else ever read it, we were writing it for ourselves and that was enough. But we're really really glad you all loved it too!
2023-04-30 23:52:52 *	Songbird has quit (Quit: https://mibbit.com Online IRC Client)
2023-04-30 23:52:58 <KathyB>	Thank you so much, everyone! We are so honored! This story was a labor of love ... to the point that "labor" probably isn't even the right term. Those hours of brainstorming were a joy. Thank you so much!
2023-04-30 23:53:16 <KathyB>	And now, to present the award for Best Long Story, we welcome Bakasi!
2023-04-30 23:53:23 *	KSaraSara whisper reminds Kathy not to say "labor" in the Kerth chats...
2023-04-30 23:53:28 *	Voice_Jockey gives voice to bakasi
2023-04-30 23:53:41 *	bakasi tries to work her way to the stage
2023-04-30 23:54:03 <bakasi>	Houdini tags along and tries to find DarthMichael to get another treat
2023-04-30 23:54:36 *	bakasi clears her throat and adjusts the mikrophone
2023-04-30 23:54:41 <bakasi>	Long stories can keep you company for weeks, if you read them as they‚Äôre posted ‚Äì or you can get lost in them for hours on end. This year we had a lot of stories that had you feel with the characters, left you at the edge of your seat while the story unfold. 
2023-04-30 23:55:05 <bakasi>	The nominees are ‚ÄúAftershocks‚Äù by Toomie8, a story in which Clark was more severely injured by his stay in Luthor‚Äôs cage. We got to see Clark dealing with the physical, but also the emotional fallout. But not only he was affected by the events.

2023-04-30 23:55:17 <bakasi>	In Federal Disaster by lovetvfan, Lois had to work with Claude again and some long suppressed emotions bubbled up that wreaked havoc in the lives of our favorite couple. 
2023-04-30 23:55:27 <bakasi>	In Savior SuperBek had Lois rescue a damaged Clark, who‚Äôd been held by Trask for years and we were witnesses to Clark‚Äôs healing process.
2023-04-30 23:55:40 <bakasi>	The next nominee is KSaraSara‚Äôs So Far Away, a sequel to the fic ‚Äúwherever you will go,‚Äù which she wrote years ago. Now, Clark has returned from New Krypton, but he carries a lot of scars on his soul that only Lois can help him heal.
2023-04-30 23:55:57 <bakasi>	Finally, there is ‚ÄúWhat the Heart wants by AnnieM and KathyB. The two authors explore an elseworld, in which Clark didn‚Äôt leave Smallville. When he and Lois meet by chance, sparks fly, but how could they make a long distance relationship work? 
2023-04-30 23:56:26 <bakasi>	Well, it was really hard to decide on this category, because all of them are so great.
2023-04-30 23:56:50 <bakasi>	And I'm sure that most readers found it equally challenging to pick the best
2023-04-30 23:57:13 <bakasi>	And the winner is...
2023-04-30 23:57:29 <bakasi>	Best long Stroy: What the Heart Wants by AnnieM and KathyB

2023-05-01 00:00:05 <AnnieM>	Although sometimes they make you laugh until you cry
2023-05-01 00:00:19 <AnnieM>	Comedy is an incredibly delicate art
2023-05-01 00:00:37 <AnnieM>	It takes true talent to find that sweet spot of hilarity that still rings true and genuine
2023-05-01 00:00:49 <AnnieM>	And doing it while keeping the characters true to themselves is an even bigger challenge
2023-05-01 00:01:14 <AnnieM>	This year we have fine hilarious contenders for the Best Comedy award. The nominees are...

2023-05-01 00:05:53 <KSaraSara>	And yes, delighted to share the award with Kryptonite Coffee! Such a fun story to read over and over for a quick laugh!
2023-05-01 00:06:55 <KSaraSara>	And gahhhh, thank you! Since I was so wrong about this fic in the first place, it doesn't surprised me that... I was a little surprised to find it in the comedy category! LOL! I'll bet Sara wasn't surprised at all! 
2023-05-01 00:08:18 <KSaraSara>	I love inserting a bit of comedy into the WAFFY stuff, and ... well, this one was just so easy to write when I think back on it! The humo(u)rous bits just wrote themselves! 
2023-05-01 00:08:40 <KSaraSara>	Thank you all so much! We're thrilled that you enjoyed the story!! 
2023-05-01 00:08:48 *	KSaraSara hands the mic back to Kathy

2023-05-01 00:09:42 <KathyB>	But don't go far, Sara ...
2023-05-01 00:10:05 <KathyB>	Because it's now time to highlight our next New Author, SuperBek!
2023-05-01 00:10:23 <KSaraSara>	What‚Äôs that in the sky? Is it a bird? A plane? A Superman? Nope... it‚Äôs our second and final new author to celebrate tonight ‚Äî SuperBek! Prolific right out of the gate, SuperBek has given us TWELVE stories in her debut year! Poignant, WaFFy, humorous, dramatic, romantic, and angsty...it seems that SuperBek can do it all! 
2023-05-01 00:10:40 <KSaraSara>	Helping to pioneer Ficlet Friday, she gave us ‚ÄúConned‚Äù (along with the ‚ÄúAbsolutely Not‚Äù challenge prompt) and had us LOL‚Äôing when... well, I won‚Äôt spoil it for you; I‚Äôll just tease you with the prompt:

2023-05-01 00:11:07 <KSaraSara>	‚ÄúWhat I said is that I‚Äôd think about it. I never promised!‚Äù
2023-05-01 00:11:07 <KSaraSara>	Lois turned toward him, scowling, and settled her hands on her hips. She had that look about her‚Äôthat look that said she wasn‚Äôt going to give in.
2023-05-01 00:11:15 <KSaraSara>	Clark hung his head in defeat and held out his hand.
2023-05-01 00:11:15 <KSaraSara>	‚ÄúOkay, well, give it to me then, and let‚Äôs get this over with.‚Äù 
2023-05-01 00:11:15 <KSaraSara>	‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought,‚Äù she gloated. *****
2023-05-01 00:11:32 <KSaraSara>	SuperBek can pack heartbreaking and wistful and poignant into a short ficlet, giving you just enough feels for a little appetizer. And yet she can also make a longer (really, really longer) story compelling all the way through with angst and feeeeels for days! 
2023-05-01 00:11:46 <KSaraSara>	She had us all crying for altClark in ‚ÄúAnchor: Part I - Clark Kent‚Äù:
2023-05-01 00:11:46 <KSaraSara>	***** Wells furrows his brow for a moment and drums his fingers on the table. He seems to be studying me intently.
2023-05-01 00:11:54 <KSaraSara>	An image of a beautiful face‚Äîhers, but not as I‚Äôve ever known it‚Äîflashes in my mind. Her smile is bright and carefree, and her long dark hair drapes down around her shoulders, curling softly at the ends. Her deep brown eyes meet mine, and my heart stops. I feel his love for her, stronger than any emotion I‚Äôve ever felt before. The air is sucked out of my lungs again.
2023-05-01 00:12:05 <KSaraSara>	‚ÄúWells, please tell me she is okay,‚Äù I beg.
2023-05-01 00:12:05 <KSaraSara>	‚ÄúOh, sorry, yes, my boy.‚Äù He nods quickly. ‚ÄúWhen I met with her, she was in good health and unharmed, although quite distraught, understandably.‚Äù
2023-05-01 00:12:17 <KSaraSara>	Relief washes over me, and I cross my arms over my chest and close my eyes.
2023-05-01 00:12:17 <KSaraSara>	‚ÄúHowever,‚Äù he says hesitantly, the word sticking to his tongue, ‚Äúthis brings me to the real reason I am here, Clark.

He is troubled again, worry lines appearing on his forehead and in the wrinkles around his eyes. ‚ÄúWhen Superman left three months ago, the world quickly fell into chaos.

2023-05-01 00:12:38 <KSaraSara>	He raises his chin slightly toward me, and I understand what he wants. I absently wonder if he has any other Clarks like me, whom he transports around the multiverse whenever a problem needs fixing. But the image of her face, filled with life and promise, flickers in my mind again, and with a sigh, I resign myself to being Wells‚Äôs personal multidimensional handyman.

2023-05-01 00:21:24 <bakasi>	Dramatic tales have in common that they send you on an emotional roller coaster ride. But even though all our nominated stories are dramatic, they also couldn‚Äôt be more different.

2023-05-01 00:30:53 <KSaraSara>	I... honestly don't know what to say... which... I know Michael is going to give me crap about because I usually talk forever...so I guess... read my author's note. That says it all... well, most of it.

2023-05-01 00:34:43 <KSaraSara>	We‚Äôre really thrilled to introduce fanart to the Kerths this year! While fanfic really is the lifeblood of our fandom, FoLC talent doesn‚Äôt stop there! 
2023-05-01 00:35:00 <KSaraSara>	Our creativity and skill as a fandom is boundless. Whether it‚Äôs stunning graphical images or evocative videos, we‚Äôre so lucky to be gifted with a visual medium as well as the textual. This year, we have four pieces of fanart that made it to our short list. They are...
2023-05-01 00:35:22 <KSaraSara>	2022 Blue Christmas graphic banner by Folc4evernaday

2023-05-01 00:36:46 <lovetvfan>	Oh wow I came on just in time!!
2023-05-01 00:37:36 <lovetvfan>	Thank you! I only taught myself to make videos a couple years ago after seeing all the talent that existed in this fandom. Thank you!!
2023-05-01 00:38:52 <KathyB>	Congratulations, Sara!
2023-05-01 00:38:57 <KathyB>	And now, to present another new category, Best Commenter/Feedback Giver, we have AnnaBtG.
2023-05-01 00:39:00 *	Voice_Jockey gives voice to AnnaBtG
2023-05-01 00:39:24 <AnnaBtG>	This one right here is my favorite category in the awards, hands down.
2023-05-01 00:39:42 <AnnaBtG>	Because, as a writer, I know that we all write because we want to, because there‚Äôs this need in us to create and play with words. And we enjoy doing it, even if it can give us a hard time.
2023-05-01 00:40:06 <AnnaBtG>	But the thing is, fandom is more than just writing. None of the stories we are celebrating here would have seen the light of day if it weren‚Äôt for the people who leave comments.
2023-05-01 00:40:24 <AnnaBtG>	Those people who may or may not be writers, but who read what we share, who tell us what our stories made them feel, who shower us with love and praise, who give us feedback and suggestions, who encourage us to write more.
2023-05-01 00:40:46 <AnnaBtG>	They turn writing from a solitary hobby to a group experience; they are the literal backbone of fandom, offering this much needed support to all the writers and becoming the glue that binds us all together.
2023-05-01 00:41:13 <AnnaBtG>	Therefore, it‚Äôs only fair that they should get a share of the spotlight tonight!
2023-05-01 00:41:29 <AnnaBtG>	It goes without saying that every little comment counts and that everyone who has ever left a comment is a winner in my books, but here‚Äôs hoping that even the shyer people and the lurkers might want to follow the example of the lovely people on this list next year!

2023-05-01 00:45:15 <KSaraSara>	Heck! I am... speechless(wish) in a different way! And maybe it's just because when voting, I automatically discounted myself! I mean... I'm my own worst critic sometimes, so... 
2023-05-01 00:46:23 <KSaraSara>	(golly... I just typed a bunch and lost it... bahhh... hang with me)
2023-05-01 00:47:46 <KSaraSara>	But really, like Anna said, it was so hard to vote here because feedback is so important! And I'm just really honored to have this award...especially since I've come back, I'm just grateful to have my fandom still here and I'm feeling a bit maternal about it lately, so if I've made people feel happy with participating in this way, then that makes it so much more rewarding!
2023-05-01 00:48:49 <KSaraSara>	So... thank you! I honestly just want to share this award with ALLLL the people who leave fdk, whether it's just a kudos or an "aww" or it's miles long feedback line by line... 
2023-05-01 00:48:59 <KSaraSara>	Thank you!
2023-05-01 00:49:05 *	KSaraSara hands mic back to Kathy
2023-05-01 00:49:19 <KathyB>	Thanks, Sara. And congratulations to all of the winners so far! What an exciting day!
2023-05-01 00:49:26 <KathyB>	Now before we get to our final award, we have one final announcement to share with you all, concerning the future of the L&C Fanfic Message Boards. 
2023-05-01 00:49:33 <KathyB>	Thank you, everyone, for all you do for the Lois & Clark fandom! It‚Äôs such a testament to the amazing FoLC community that we‚Äôre still going strong after 30 years. And I know that with your support, we‚Äôll continue well into the future. Should we shoot for 30 more? I hope so!
2023-05-01 00:49:54 <KathyB>	Right now, we are already funded for 2024 and most of 2025 even before we could do a major fundraiser. 
2023-05-01 00:50:08 <KathyB>	And that‚Äôs awesome! Since so many of us also love swag and because there is no such thing as being overfunded, we are in the process of mapping out another fundraiser. 
2023-05-01 00:50:14 <KathyB>	The last one was in 2014 and we got to auction off everything from little works of art you could take with you to labors of love done in word and picture. 
2023-05-01 00:50:21 <KathyB>	We will be announcing the details in a bit, this was just to give you guys a head‚Äôs up and get the creative juices flowing!
2023-05-01 00:50:50 <KathyB>	And now, what you‚Äôve all been waiting for ‚Ä¶
2023-05-01 00:50:55 <KathyB>	To present the award for Best Overall Story for 2022, please welcome Toomi to the stage!
2023-05-01 00:50:57 *	Voice_Jockey gives voice to Toomi
2023-05-01 00:51:03 <Toomi>	It's amazing how much time and effort, along with questionable browser histories, are poured into a story.
2023-05-01 00:51:17 <Toomi>	The one hundred stories that were eligible for this year's Kerth Awards represent hours, days, weeks, months, and even years - you know who you are - of work.
2023-05-01 00:51:27 <Toomi>	Of these one hundred, five were nominated for the Best Overall category.
2023-05-01 00:51:35 <Toomi>	And the nominees are:
2023-05-01 00:51:46 <Toomi>	Federal Disaster by lovetvfan

2023-05-01 00:53:31 *	Voice_Jockey removes voice from Toomi
2023-05-01 00:53:57 <AnnieM>	 I'm overwhelmed by all the love for this story tonight. Thank you all so much. To be completely honest, this has been a rough couple of years for me and this story was very much my happy place. This was where I went when I needed to escape into a world that happy and hopeful.
2023-05-01 00:54:40 <AnnieM>	When I was first plotting it out, I was thinking about all the trauma the characters went through on the show. All the near death experiences and derailed weddings. 
2023-05-01 00:55:00 <AnnieM>	I had just finished writing Come to Me, which tried to deal with those traumas and the fallout from them in a realistic way
2023-05-01 00:55:27 *	Toomi (Mibbit@cloak-71D871AA.cg.shawcable.net) has left
2023-05-01 00:55:28 <AnnieM>	And I wanted to do something entirely different. I wanted a world where they never had to face those traumas at all. Where they could fall in love as just normal people.
2023-05-01 00:56:13 <AnnieM>	Now, clearly there was drama along the way ;) but I did manage to give them all the happiness I thought they deserved. And I'm so glad the readers enjoyed that ride as much as I enjoyed writing it.
2023-05-01 00:57:15 *	KathyB hugs Annie really hard
2023-05-01 00:57:37 <AnnieM>	And finally, a huge thanks to Kathy. Who got dragged into this project as a beta reader and then conscripted into the role of co-author. She went above and beyond, as she always does.
2023-05-01 00:57:46 <AnnieM>	 And I will never be able to put into words how happy it makes to me wake up in the morning from a message from her that starts "I was up in the middle of the night thinking about that scene where...."
2023-05-01 00:58:08 <AnnieM>	This whole process was a joy, and this award means the world to us! Thank you all!
2023-05-01 00:58:23 <KathyB>	Thank you, to everyone who voted, and especially thank you to Annie, who let me tag along on this incredible journey. And yes, this was literally a story that made me wake up at 3 am, grab my phone, and text her my thoughts in the middle of the night, LOL!
2023-05-01 00:58:46 <KathyB>	Thank you, all, from the bottom of our hearts!
2023-05-01 00:59:06 <KathyB>	And with that, I can't believe the 2023 Kerths are in the books!
2023-05-01 00:59:07 <KathyB>	What an exciting night! We‚Äôre so delighted you could all join us today, and we can‚Äôt wait to see what 2023 will bring for L&C fanfic. One final announcement before we wrap up the ceremony, the 25th Annual Kerth Awards.
2023-05-01 00:59:20 <KathyB>	Our website kerthawards.com is going to be moving to a new home during the first week of May. While we will try to keep the move interruption free, it‚Äôs the first move done in years. 
2023-05-01 00:59:26 <KathyB>	This means it is possible that the Kerth website might be unreachable for a day or so until the Internet name system catches up with the new address. So, if you notice anything, please don‚Äôt panic, it‚Äôs all part of a scheduled maintenance operation.
2023-05-01 00:59:41 <KathyB>	And with that, we're done! Please stick around in #kerthchat to congratulate the winners and enjoy chatting with your fellow FoLCs. Have a wonderful rest of your day, everyone! See you next year!
2023-05-01 01:00:22 <KSaraSara>	(Or... if Discord is more comfortable... heh...)
2023-05-01 01:00:39 <KathyB>	Or Discord! Ha!
