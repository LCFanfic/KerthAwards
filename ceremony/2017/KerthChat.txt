CLeuch FYI I'm here but not full time. I'm out with the family and checking in on my phone. So if I'm not immediately responsive, that's why. And I mostly hate typing on my phone...
Mouserocks hi all! (this is mouse on dayquil, hoping to stay awake... but excited!)
Virginia R
Good afternoon, all. I'm going off and on, too. BRB. Laundry calls.
Folc4evernaday No prob. Glad to have you with us
Deadly Chakram No problem, I've got my two 3.5 year olds with me, so if I go *poof*, you know why
Folc4evernaday
Deadly Chakram That vid was awesome
Virginia R I'm back.
Folc4evernaday
Counting down with videos haha
Virginia R Mouse, good to see you back on the boards. Got any new stories for us?
Hint. Hint.
Mouserocks AWW! THAT WAS SO CUTE!
Deadly Chakram[Ha, Mouse inspired me with her last one!
Virginia R Which story was that, DC?
Morgana Hi Mouse! Glad to see you here!
Deadly Chakram Dying To Fit In
Folc4evernaday I'll admit I've been MIA on the boards since Tuesday....I just now went on there. Holy cow I've got a lot to catch up on this weekend
Virginia R] Ahhh. Right. Memory. It's the first thing that goes.
Mouserocks haha, thanks virginia maybe... I know I've been talking about it forever, but I'm finishing up on my antiverse still (mwahaha)
Morgana
Yes! A great story!
Mouserocks
40 chapters tho...
Deadly Chakram
Thanks!
Virginia - I can now forget things AS I do them!
Morgana
Forty Chapters? Yahoo!
Folc4evernaday
40 Chapters? Nice!
NostalgiaKick
That's a side effect of having kids, Vicki
Virginia R
Is that the one where there's the crazy super that kills people?
Mouserocks
nope... different one.
Groobie
Dang, that's impressive. I am in awe of authors that can sustain such long stories.
Virginia R
Definitely. Kids have more energy (and brains) inversely to their parents.
Groobie, your stories have bang (no pun intended) for the buck though.
Folc4evernaday
...and it's SO NOT FAIR
Morgana
Dinner is almost done! Than I can join in on the fun!
Deadly Chakram
Who needs to remember whu I'm at the store? I know all the words to Moana!
Folc4evernaday
I wish I had half of my 1 year old's energy
Mouserocks
tell me about it, susan. idk how y'all do all these long stories it takes forever!! i've stopped and started so many times!
NostalgiaKick
Ditto, Val!
Gotta agree with Mouse there... long stories are so hard
Folc4evernaday
I have the opposite problem. I don't know when to stop writing
Virginia R
I've been working on Wrong Clark longer than LnC was on the air (one of my betas likes to remind me). Really got to finish that one, one of these days.
Groobie
bwaahaaahaaa...yes, my stories do often have bang
Folc4evernaday
Short and Super Shorts are hard for me to do.
NostalgiaKick
ROFL
Mouserocks
i do. i stop midsentence. lol
Groobie
(including the one that's in process )
Virginia R
I also find Shorts and Super Shorts challenging. I even challenged myself to write some a few years back when I had free time. LOL. So long ago.
Deadly Chakram
I am in awesome of Virginia's word counts on the boards. I wish I could write that epic
NostalgiaKick
Free time? What's that?
Folc4evernaday
All right everyone we're now at the midway point. 30 minutes till we start. Presenting the Nominees for the Annual 2017 Kerth Awards:

Virginia R
Free time is what kids have but waste without even knowing it.
Folc4evernaday
And that's the last of the videos haha
Groobie
those banners are so awesome! Truly a gift - thanks!
Virginia R
Well done. /applause/ I'd love to learn how to do those, but I think I'll stick to writing.
Mouserocks
These vids are so amazing!
Folc4evernaday
Graphic Design and Adobe Master Creative Suite
Thanks. Glad you enjoyed them
Virginia R
Thanks, DC. It's called rambling on until you figure out where the scene is going and then your character create 4 more plot threads without you noticing until you try to tie them up at the end.

Deadly Chakram
{Mom joke alert} Her skills have been invaluable to the Kcom!
Mouserocks
rofl
Deadly Chakram
ugh VAL was supposed to be in caps
must have autocorrected
*sigh*
and this is why I suck at comedy
CLeuch
Writing long stories with kids around isn't so bad. Just wait till naptime / bedtime.
Virginia R
LOL. I can recall some good side-splitters coming from you, DC.
Deadly Chakram
Hehe thanks
I wish naptime was a thing - mine quit last sumemr
summer
Virginia R
Bravo, if you get your kids to nap. Now, that my kids are tweens, it's always, "Get off the computer, mom."
Deadly Chakram
LMAO
Virginia R
My daughter quit napping at 9 mo. My son at like 3-4 years. Gotta love him!
Deadly Chakram
9 MONTHS???I would have dieds
died
Virginia R
She got hand-and-mouth and couldn't suck her thumb any more. She's had trouble falling asleep since then (now 12). Sigh. Just like her mommy. A night owl.
NostalgiaKick
That's about the time we managed to get Becky to sleep at all
Deadly Chakram
Ugh that stinks about HaM
NostalgiaKick
Insomnia is not pretty

Virginia R
What a beautiful butterfly, Cuidadora (did I spell that right)?
Cuidadora
Yes. and thanks
NostalgiaKick
20 minutes
Deadly Chakram
Yes, very pretty!
Virginia R
Oops. Forgot to set a timer for the laundry. Better check it before the show starts.
BRB
Deadly Chakram
That was me before - unplanned laundry
ah, potty training
CLeuch
Video games keep the older ones away while mommy writes. And all the time you spend not writing but wishing you could is actually good for refining plot and such. (yes I like to look on the bright side of things)
LMA
Hi, everyone! Congratulations to all the nominees! I have a family commitment in a few minutes but wanted to pop in and wish everyone good luck. Can't wait to read the transcript!
NostalgiaKick
Just a quick thing. Anyone that isn't able to stay for the whole ceremony, we will be live tweeting the winners as they're announced under the hashtag #kerthawards2017

LMA
Great idea to tweet.
Virginia R
Back. My kids are glued to the old phone (no service) and the tablets, so I have to have electronic free days, which they usually cheat on. Hubby has taken my son and playmate to the park. My daughter SAYS she's reading. I'm betting tablet, though.
NostalgiaKick
My 5yr old is awake, the 3yr old is still sleeping
Kissmatt
3 years. WOwsers
NostalgiaKick
Yup, crazy hey?
Virginia R
I've decided to limit my social media (cold turkey). FB is taking me away from my writing and just makes me depressed.
NostalgiaKick
Becky turned 5 yesterday too, Kelly
Kissmatt
FB always makes me depressed. All my old HS people have 2-4 kids and are way more social than I am
NostalgiaKick
My girls are growing up
Kissmatt
she's 5!!! omg
Virginia R
My old HS friends are traveling the world. One went to Sri Lanka this year and another just went to Australia. Me, I'm lucky if I can drive an hour to go to Target. Depressing.
NostalgiaKick
Yup! Starts school next year (should've been this year but we delayed her due to her autism)
Kissmatt
Here, we start kindergarten after they are 5. I think the cutoff date has been moved to Aug 15, they usually start school around then
Different states have different age cutoffs, tho
NostalgiaKick
Usually they start prep (first year of formal schooling) they year they turn 5 here

Deadly Chakram
Yeah, Kindy is age 5 here
NostalgiaKick
Kindy is the year they turn 4
Kissmatt
*noogies Vic*
Deadly Chakram
Hiya Kells!
*pounce*
10 mins to go!
Kissmatt
I am in the middle of a thunderstorm here so if I disappear that's why
Virginia R
Better check laundry again before we start. BRB
NostalgiaKick
Uh oh, no tornadoes I hope!
Lynn S.M.
Hi All! Don't tell anyone, byt my secret identity is Lynn S. M.
NostalgiaKick
Ten minute warning!
Kissmatt
There was a tornado warning just northeat of me
NostalgiaKick
Are all our presenters ready?
Mouserocks
hi lynn!
Deadly Chakram
Secret identy? Wait, I have a pair of glasses for that!
Groobie
I'm good to go
Kissmatt
the sky was black!, and it went from no rain to sideways in like 10 seconds. You could see it coming
NostalgiaKick
Hi Lynn! Glad you made it
Lynn S.M.
I'm confuzled... I am in the HanHi Viki... I've some coke-bottles sitting on my nose as I type...
Kissmatt

Cuidadora
I'm ready
Kissmatt

Lynn S.M.
Not sure how long I'll be able to stay... DS has been wanting more attention from me this afternoon than he has in weeks. (He's a teen and I'm his mother -- he usually wants nothing to do with me these days.)
Mouserocks
got my fresh tea and giant water bottle and tissues... settling in wink
NostalgiaKick
My household is starting to wake up
Deadly Chakram
Okay, kids are all squared away with dinner and hubby is supervising dessert
Virginia R
I'm back. Laundry's not ready, so it'll have to sit. Hi Lynn!
Deadly Chakram
Different glasses, Lynn - gets them every time
Virginia R
Maybe we should do a shoutout with our handle so we know who all is here. Virginia R.
Deadly Chakram

Deadly Chakram
Yeah, she totally rocked it
Folc4evernaday
Kelly:

Kissmatt
Thx
Lynn S.M.
I've enjoyed all the lead-in events I had the time to partake of (which, alas, were nowhere near as many as I would have liked). Everything has been at such a professional level; I'm suprt impressed.
Kissmatt
It's probably in my Watch list, I have all of yours subbed, but I didn't know which one in particular
NostalgiaKick
It's been a super busy 8 weeks
Deadly Chakram
Thanks Lynn! We're hoping that, with more time, we'll be able to do more next year (unless you all hate our K-com work)
Cuidadora
I LOVE IT!!!
Lynn S.M.
Even more? Wow! I can't imagine what other ideas you have in mind, but I am eager to find out. (And I hope next year I'll only be doing the work of two people, rather than three, at my job, so I might actually have a little more time to indulge.)
Mouserocks
definitely looking forward to more!! didn't realize i'd missed out on so much!
Groobie
I love the original/supporting character category
Deadly Chakram
We'd love to bring the category specific quizzes back - just no time this year
Folc4evernaday
It's okay Virginia Word hates us too
NostalgiaKick
8 weeks from eligible list to here
Deadly Chakram
LOL I took "extra characters" as a joke
Lynn S.M.
Extra characters are actually pretty appropriate there; no apologies necessary.
Kissmatt
so did I
Mouserocks
hahaha

Deadly Chakram
Glad to be in good company!
Folc4evernaday
Awww Barry
NostalgiaKick
He was funny
Groobie
I love Barry Or, I would, if I could afford his rate LOL
Deadly Chakram
Snork!
NostalgiaKick
LOL
Folc4evernaday
haha OMG
Lynn S.M.
I always thought Barry was underutilized on the show. I wish he had appeared in more than one episode. So many untapped possibilities.5:10 PM
Virginia R
LOL
Lynn S.M.
Love the nun!
Deadly Chakram
That would have been hilarious!
Nun was great
Groobie
Daae....yeah, amazing!
Lynn S.M.
... But *not*in the same way that Susan would love Barry...
Kissmatt
lol groooooooooooobie
NostalgiaKick
LOL
Folc4evernaday
lol
Lynn S.M.
1 of 5 -- what a gripping story.
Folc4evernaday
No one could love him the way Groobie would
Groobie
I doubt my version of Barry would have made an appearance at 8am on ABC
NostalgiaKick
There were some really stellar OCs this year
Deadly Chakram
*bites tongue*
CLeuch
Great job of summing up the nominated characters
Lynn S.M.
True. I guess nowadays they could have had a "mature audiences" online spinoff
Deadly Chakram
LOL Virginia
Lynn S.M.
Way to build suspense...
Kissmatt
A tie!
Lynn S.M.
The first category and already a tie?
NostalgiaKick
Nice suspense Virginia!
Deadly Chakram
One of CLark's wild ties?
Lynn S.M.

Cuidadora
My computer is freezing up on me. AARGH!!
Deadly Chakram
Oh no!
NostalgiaKick
Oh no!
Folc4evernaday
Try your phone?
Or log in and out it might just be tired
Cuidadora
Yeah, working on that
Lynn S.M.
Of all the times for it to freeze. I hope that it thaws and stays warm, so to speak, at least for the rest of the ceremony.
Morgana
Ciudadora
Kissmatt
At least we don't have play-them-out music
Morgana
is there anything I can say for you?
Deadly Chakram
Send in Supes! We need heat vision for all the freezing!
Virginia R
LOL
Morgana
Yes! Heat vision
Lynn S.M.
Or maybe Jimmie could fix it; after all, heat vision might melt a component.
Oops... Jimmy
NostalgiaKick
My thoughts exactly Lynn
Folc4evernaday
Loved her!
Morgana
Get KenJ on it!
Kissmatt
lol
Virginia R
That's a great scene! /clapping/
Lynn S.M.
Love meta-humor. In fact, (I've never meta-humor I didn't like. )
Folc4evernaday
haha
Mouserocks
rofl that scene was great!
Deadly Chakram
LOL
Virginia R
A personal super hero. I could use one of those.
Kissmatt
Plus, she doesn't have to clock in at work
Virginia R
Oh, Lynn. LOL.,
Lynn S.M.
And you know that Clark wouldnever drag her off the plane. (Take that however you want...)
Mouserocks
*whistles*
Virginia R
I don't think that's what "Revalation" means, Darth Michael.
NostalgiaKick
LOL
Lynn S.M.
Literally laughing as I type...
Deadly Chakram
I think Lois wouldn't mind that definition
Kissmatt
Yeah, he has nice.....assets
Deadly Chakram
mmmmmmmmmmm
NostalgiaKick
No argument here!
Lynn S.M.
He does have a gorgeous S.

Deadly Chakram
They don't call'em tights for nothin!
Lynn S.M.
He matches his cape.
Groobie
Hey, this is a chat designed for me! But I'm slightly busy now
Deadly Chakram
lol
Virginia R
Lois would feel guilty for any Pulitzer she won this way.
Kissmatt
She wouldn....for abouta second
Mouserocks

Virginia R

Kissmatt
woot Terry!
Morgana
Great Story! Those red eyes of Clark's as he looked at Lex about to die. Chilling.
Lynn S.M.
Hence the "wherever you are"
Virginia R
I love that end scene. Terrific Revelation.
Deadly Chakram

Groobie
LMA loves WAFF
Lynn S.M.
That was beautiful. I wish LMA would write fanfic.
Folc4evernaday
Yes, she has a beautiful style /* hinthint*/
Deadly Chakram
Agreed!
Groobie
She's working on one. Sloooooooowly, but she is
NostalgiaKick
Good, can't wait to read it
Lynn S.M.
I hope she finishes and posts it by the summer, so I'll have time to read it.
I wonder how Lois would spell "Mamihlapinatapei"?
Kissmatt
lol poor clark
Groobie
love how she pulled out each of the kiss quotes from the stories for the ceremony
Morgana
I hope to read it someday soon.
Groobie
LOL...spell check would not have helped!
Folc4evernaday
He's just used for Lois to play games with
Erica Hulstrom joined the conversation
NostalgiaKick
I keep copy/pasting Mamihlapinatapei. Otherwise I get it wrong lol
Lynn S.M.
I wonder what spell check would do with it... Word didn't even offer a suggestion.
Folc4evernaday
haha
Kissmatt
You know? You can tell Word to Autocorrect a short word to that
Groobie
love needs no language
Kissmatt
you type Mami and it fills the rest in
Lynn S.M.
Well, NK, I think it is quite probably that if you had misspelled it, no casual reader would have caught the error/
NostalgiaKick
True that!
Groobie
I doubt I would have caught it! lol
Morgana
It was an unusual word.
Mouserocks
it's more fun to make other, regular words autocorrect to it
Folc4evernaday
Poor Vicki
I think we all need a tall glass of something cool after this
NostalgiaKick
That's a heck of a speech
Folc4evernaday

That's it - next year I feed everyone we don't want to show up food from Ralph's Pagoda
Folc4evernaday
haha
Groobie
No A-plot? That's EVERY one of my stories! LOL
NostalgiaKick
I'm not so great wiht the speeches lol
Virginia R
I find A-Plots the hardest.
Morgana
That was a fine speech! Well done!
Virginia R
Best Villain awards?
Kissmatt
I thought he was dead?
Groobie
I can't write A plots...am just amazed by those who can!
Morgana
Ok, that's it. Somebody get Batman in here!
Lynn S.M.
Same here, Susan... That's onle of many reasons I go for the super-shorts.
Virginia R
Someone nudge him through that time-window.
Folc4evernaday
lmao Virginia
Kissmatt
Let's put Lex, Tempus and Trask in the same room.
Folc4evernaday
haha!
Virginia R
I believe that's happened once or twice.
Lynn S.M.
Our version of the Superman Revenge Squad.
BRB. DS wants some attention...
Kissmatt
Trask plus Nor. ACK
Virginia R
A testament to our lack of a social life.
Deadly Chakram
Add Nor in that room for max ego
Kissmatt
>hands over the brain*
Deadly Chakram
Serious! We always do that!
Kissmatt
lol I know!
Deadly Chakram
Gotta write something together - could be scary fun!
Virginia R
That was a scary battle with Doomsday.
Lynn S.M.
...Back already. He just wanted me to step away from the computer for a couple of seconds...
Deadly Chakram
Anti K is so good I get scared to read her new chapters
Morgana
My heart gets the chills whenever I think about that story.
NostalgiaKick
Her stories are always heartwrenching
Virginia R
Krypton's Legacy was so sad.
Deadly Chakram
I have to mentally prepare myself to open AntiK's chapters lol
Virginia R
But it's always worth it in the end.
Kissmatt
Yay!
Cuidadora
I have to wait for the finished story to read AntiK stories.
NostalgiaKick
Woohoo, Morgana!
Virginia R
Congrats, Morgana. A riveting tale.
Deadly Chakram
Oh yeah, Virginia!
Groobie
Amazing story! Vive l'empereur!

Multi-award-winning story right there!

AntiK's fics are some of those I reread again and again
Mouserocks
congratulations morgana!!
Folc4evernaday
mwahaha
Demi Ulithi
Congrats Morgana
Virginia R
I could totally see them doing that, especially after all those other characters snuck into the ceremony.
Groobie
Original character, fabulous use of supporting characters, complex plot, and Napoleon Bonaparte...what's not to love?
NostalgiaKick
Incredible job, Morgana
Virginia R
Wow, already!
Groobie
Too fast...we need more categories
Mouserocks
i know!
NostalgiaKick
We're working on that
We need more stories
Deadly Chakram
We're definitely considering more for next year!
Mouserocks
turned the tables back on us, huh?
Lynn S.M.
We always need more stories, no matter how many there are... Always room for more.
Deadly Chakram
Agreed, Lynn!
NostalgiaKick
Not just you guys, us too.
Virginia R
I've doubled the length of my epic. Does that count? /duck and hides/
Kissmatt
It's hard with no channel airing the eps
Groobie
lol virginia
Mouserocks

Kissmatt
Another tie!
Groobie
no
Kissmatt
Congrats Morgana and Groobie!!!
Deadly Chakram
Yeah, I miss when it was The Hub and every Sun night they had the eps
Groobie
that's not possible
Mouserocks
congrats to both of you guys!!
Lynn S.M.
Congrats Susan and Morgana. You'll both need to clear off a lot of well-lit shelf space for all of those Kerths!
Cuidadora
Congratulations Susan and Morgana!! Great stories!
Folc4evernaday
Yes it is
Virginia R
Congrats, Susan and Morgana! Great stories.
Folc4evernaday
Congrats to both of you!
Deadly Chakram
Congrats you two!
Awesome work!
Groobie
Well, I voted for Airport!
Demi Ulithi
Congrats you two
Deadly Chakram
LOL
NostalgiaKick
Congrats to you both, your stories were absolutely wonderful
Kissmatt

Morgana
WOW!
Thank you all.
Virginia R
Best feedback. LMA and Darth Michael would tie.
Folc4evernaday
***drops mic*** Write MORE????
Morgana
ABSOLUTELY!!!!
Folc4evernaday
Did everyone hear that????
Kissmatt
Yup!
Groobie
lol...I'm working on it. But only you naughty boys and girls will get a peek at it
Lynn S.M.
Agreed, Virginia. They provide very different types of feedback, but they both excel in giving feedback -- both in quantity and quality.
Deadly Chakram
Haha, yes, hands down they would!
Virginia R
Aw, shucks, Groobie. Poor us.
Folc4evernaday
So excited....
Groobie
I'd make a pg version, but....well, there wouldn't be much left lol
Lynn S.M.
So very true, Cuidadora -- every word you just wrote.
NostalgiaKick
YES!
Virginia R
My son tells me that he gets 'building blocks' for Legos like my writer's block.
I have a story like that, Susan. Actually, I was reading it again last night.
Folc4evernaday
Awww
Morgana
Cuidadora what great words!
So true.
Deadly Chakram
LOL aww, that's so cute, Virginia!
Lynn S.M.
I think your son is onto a new item for sale -- Lego shaped blocks with plot prompts, character prompts, etc... Pull out a random set of blocks, put them together, and then write a story from them.
Morgana
Good heavens! I need to finish a couple of stories for next year.
Deadly Chakram
I would buy those!
Virginia R
Congrat, Nivafer!
Groobie
So deserving...what an introduction to the boards! Congrats, Nivafrer!
Deadly Chakram
Congrats Nivafer!
Lynn S.M.
Congrats, Nivafer!
Morgana
Nivafer!
Mouserocks
congrats nivafrer!
Virginia R
Great idea, Lynn.
Folc4evernaday
Big congrats!
Morgana
Her computer died, but I will let her know.
Groobie
what a fabulous banner for that story!
NostalgiaKick
Big congrats to Nivafrer!
Kissmatt
Congrats!!
Virginia R
Great allegory or is it metaphor, Cuidadora. Awards vs. elections.
Cuidadora
Thanks Virginia.
Mouserocks
there's a lot of stories i still need to catch up on... looking forward to them all!!
Morgana
Have a good evening one and all.
Groobie
Thanks, KComm, for all of your work!
Virginia R
Well, I have to sneak off now and get dressed for Prom.
Mouserocks
yes, awesome job, k-comm!
Virginia R
Let's hope that dress still fits.
Deadly Chakram
Have fun at prom Virginia!
Morgana
Hubby and I are going to 'celebrate' the win.
Lynn S.M.
Thanks all for a fun ceremony -- from the KCOMM who came up with all sorts of wonderful activities, videos, etc., leading up to the ceremony, to those who wrote and/or made the presentations, to the FoLCS who were here chatting, and especially to those who wrote the fanfic which we celebrated tonight. Congrats to all the winners and nominees!
Virginia R
Yes! Thank you lots, K-Comm!
Morgana
Thank you K-Comm!
Mouserocks
you're going to prom, virginia?
Lynn S.M.
I wish I could stay longer, but DS has been getting increasingly antsy...
Deadly Chakram
Thanks for coming, everyone! We had a blast doing this!
Virginia R
Chaperoning Prom.
Cuidadora
Thanks K-Comm! Awesome job!!
Folc4evernaday
Have fun Virginia!
Deadly Chakram
I have about 30 mins before the bedtime routine starts
Folc4evernaday
Definitely celebrate Morgana!
Morgana
There was a lot of hard work that went into this and it shows!
Mouserocks
lol fun full night then! have fun!
Virginia R
Time to write a super short story, DC. /duck and runs/
Demi Ulithi
You too, have a good evening and thanks to all of you who put so much work into the ceremony
Kissmatt
great job, everyone!
NostalgiaKick
Congratulations to all our winners and nominees
Deadly Chakram
I wish! My muse seems to be allergic to short, simple stories
Virginia R left the conversation
Deadly Chakram
Thanks, everyone!
NostalgiaKick
You are all keeping our fandom alive, and I for one appreciate that greatly
Mouserocks
also want to mention that i like the hangouts format. irc was easy enough to use, but this was even easier
Groobie
agreed...loved using Google Hangouts! Thank you for this!
Deadly Chakram
Glad you liked it!
Cuidadora
Yes, Google hangouts definitely trumps IRC.
Kissmatt
Poor IRC, its age is showing
Deadly Chakram
Yeah, unfortunately it does
And this gave us the option to post the banners too
NostalgiaKick
Poor old IRC is a dinosaur
Mouserocks
which was awesome and so very worth it
Cuidadora
The banners were awesome, as were the videos.
NostalgiaKick
Val did an incredible job with them
Mouserocks
i know! that's so cool that dean and teri responded to them too!
CLeuch
Want to thank everyone for the nominations. They are great incentive to keep the creative juices flowing
Deadly Chakram
Yes, they were incredibly cool to RT and respond to the vids!
Mouserocks
^absolutely
Cuidadora
I agree with you, Cindy! And your stories are wonderful.
Kissmatt
I have a lot of reading to do lol
Mouserocks
same
Deadly Chakram
I can't wait to see how difficult the voting is next year with all the awesome stories!
NostalgiaKick
Story count for next year is already looking amazing
CLeuch
Thanks!
NostalgiaKick
(yes, we're keeping track lol)
Deadly Chakram
Already in the 40s for next year's count
Groobie
Wow!
Cuidadora
WOW!! Glad someone is keeping track. I imagine it's easier to do it as you go rather than at the end of the year.
Deadly Chakram
Ha, should be MUCH easier
NostalgiaKick
Way easier than trying to do the eligible list in three days lol
Mouserocks
Wow! 40s? That's awesome!
Deadly Chakram
OMG, that was crazy - I still don't know how we pulled that off in 3 days
NostalgiaKick
I'd LOVE to see the story count break triple digits
Deadly Chakram
Me too!
CLeuch
Gotta keep writing so I can maybe finally win one
Mouserocks
challenge accepted.... jk
NostalgiaKick
Looking at all the authors here lol
Groobie
lol...message received ¬¬¬¬¬
