DeadlyChakram: Back with Superman slippers smile
NostalgiaKick: Haha, gotta love the Superman merch floating around in this chatroom
I'm using your mug atm Vicki
DeadlyChakram: I had a Superman tshirt on today but changed to Mickey Mouse PJs after I gave the girls their bath. Ohh yay! Glad you can use it, Feli!
NostalgiaKick: It gets used a lot
Millefeuilles: Hubby's sleeping like a log... smile And I'm sitting in our bed, laptop on my kneesâ€¦
Endelda: howdy!
Millefeuilles: Hi!
Cuidadora: Hi Endelda
DeadlyChakram: Hiya Endelda!
Lynn S.M.: Hi FoLCs.
Endelda: hello smile

DeadlyChakram: Haha I think you're alone there, Feli razz
NostalgiaKick: Hey Endelda, hey Lynn smile
Endelda: lol
Lynn S.M.: I am really Lynn S. M. (Annette let me borrow an account.)

NostalgiaKick: Hahaha
DeadlyChakram: BTW, Nice Banner, Val!
CarrieRene: Nothing wrong with Vicki time.
NostalgiaKick: I have multiple world clocks on my phone so I know what the heck time it is where Val and Vicki are
DeadlyChakram: Haha, I know you love me, Val! That's why your clock is set to mine grin
Morgana: Banner is perfect!
Folc4evernaday: Thanks

DeadlyChakram: An up front congrats to all tonight for having awesome stories and being a part of this!

Congratulations to all three new authors, and welcome!

Lynn S.M.: What a lovely Kerth. Much nicer than a glass rock. wink
Folc4evernaday: Congrats Mille!
NostalgiaKick: Speech! Very well-deserved award smile
Lynn S.M.: Your stories are doubly amazing since they aren't even in your first language. (I wish my native-English-speaking students wrote a tenth as well.)
DeadlyChakram: Right, Lynn? I was going to say something along those lines
NostalgiaKick: Yup, you're right there Lynn. I'm constantly in awe of our non-native English speaking writers
Millefeuilles: Screamed so loudly that I woke up my husband!!
Cuidadora: Absolutely, Lynn! Yay Emma!
Morgana: The sequel was very sweet. Glad you wrote it.
Millefeuilles: You made me do it, so THANK YOU.
Morgana: Urgh Ralph!
CarrieRene: Congratulations again from a fellow nominee.
Lynn S.M.: OH, no... Not Ralph. wink (He gives all Ralph's a bad name...) Looking forward to what he has to say here, though.
Millefeuilles: not THAT guy... lol
Lynn S.M.: LOL!
Endelda: think, wish, potato potahto
Millefeuilles: Help, Superman... Ralph's here.
Cuidadora: LOL!!
Morgana: technical problems!!!
Lynn S.M.: Am I experiencing technical difficulties? The last thing I saw was Ralph asking "As what?"
Millefeuilles: So did I.
Folc4evernaday: No Morgana's trying to reconnect
Lynn S.M.: Oops... I think Cynthia answered the question even as I was typing.
NostalgiaKick: No, you're fine, we lost Morgana
Lynn S.M.: Ralph must have messed things up.
Endelda: Leave it to Ralph
DeadlyChakram: It's always Ralph's fault. Guy's a disaster
Millefeuilles: Someone has frozen Ralf... Good thing, considering.
DeadlyChakram: Thanks, Mr. Wells, for bringing Morgana back!
Mouserocks: Ohh coming in late.. Congrats Millefeuilles!!
Morgana: Fixed it!
DeadlyChakram: Hiya Emma!
Lynn S.M.: Nice ad libbing.
Millefeuilles: Thanks... I'm still in shock.
Mouserocks: ((Also I didn't know you were an Emma too!)
Millefeuilles: Yes, an Emmanuelle, actually!
Mouserocks: Pretty! Love that name. I always tell people Emma is a name for only smart and beautiful people (btw is it displaying me as mouse or Emma?)
DeadlyChakram: Feli - Queen of the Super short razz

DeadlyChakram: Bwhaha, right? He looks so PAINED
Millefeuilles: Oh, yeeeees.
NostalgiaKick: Scarred for life lol
Lynn S.M.: Is this "our" Lana (whom we never met) or alt-Lana?
Either way, she is definitely not right for Clark...
Millefeuilles: That's for sure.
Lynn S.M.: Lana has the "less" down pat... But in her case, less is less.
Endelda: Yay, a tie!
CarrieRene: Yay for Val! And Maggie
Lynn S.M.: Congrats to both the winners. smile
Millefeuilles: Congrats, you 2!

Millefeuilles: Oh, yay!
Morgana: Well deserved, you worked hard for it.
Cuidadora: Definitely well deserved!
Lynn S.M.: If they let Ralph do a category, will he go away?
Endelda: I'm not sure Ralph would go away if you flushed twice
Lynn S.M.: ROTFL
NostalgiaKick: Bahahaha
Millefeuilles: LOL
Cuidadora: LOL
Lynn S.M.: Another tie?
Endelda: flip it over!
Lynn S.M.: Good question, Lois -- guess that's why you're the star reporter.
CarrieRene: OOps.... I guess it's better than a miscount
Morgana: A crime has been committed!
Millefeuilles: Tempus did it!
Kathryn84: Ralph changed envelopes?
Morgana: Somebody call Inspector Henderson!
Endelda: I make a mean meatloaf from-scratch mashed potatoes too
Lynn S.M.: As long as it isn't from Ralph's Pagoda. (There's that name again...)
CarrieRene: Ralph is all over the place.
Lynn S.M.: Three-way? Wow!
Endelda: wow, a three way!
NostalgiaKick: Bahahahahahaha
Lynn S.M.: Yay, Val, Thomas MC, and Morgana.
NostalgiaKick: Sorry, but I hang out with Val and Vicki- dirty mind razz
Millefeuilles: wow.... Yay!

Cuidadora: Congrats all three of you!!!Morgana! Well done
CarrieRene: Congrats Morgana, Val and Thomas
DeadlyChakram: Five years - ouch! And I thought roaming around Gotham for a year with my Batman trilogy was long razz
NostalgiaKick: Suddenly I don't feel quite so bad for *still* working on Unmasked
DeadlyChakram: LOL
Morgana: I was writing Airport.
DeadlyChakram: Makes sense
NostalgiaKick: Airport was wonderful
Morgana: That was a real monster...
Millefeuilles: but a delightful monster...
Morgana: Absolutely!
DeadlyChakram: Happy to be a sounding board, Val!
DeadlyChakram: Congrats Val! First time winner and racking them up!
Morgana: Val you are having a great year!
Lynn S.M.: Congrats to both of you. You'll need to clear some extra room on the wall for those Kerths...
NostalgiaKick: Kerthalanche
DeadlyChakram: LMAO!
Millefeuilles: Congrats Val!
DeadlyChakram: I looooooves my banner

Morgana: Congratulations ladies!
Cuidadora: WCWWCongrats!ow
Millefeuilles: congrats, Vicky! Well deserved, you 2!
NostalgiaKick: Super proud of my KCOM buddies atm
DeadlyChakram: Thanks smile Embracing was a bit outside of my comfort zone but it was fun
NostalgiaKick: Your muse's holiday in Gotham was well spent lol
Millefeuilles: Outside your comfort zone makes excellent reading!
Lynn S.M.: Seems like being out of one's comfort zone is a good way to get a Kerth this year. wink
DeadlyChakram: Thanks smile
Morgana: Stepping into a new arena pulls those writing muscles ...
in a good way!
DeadlyChakram: Clark as Nightwing is allllll sorts of drooly
Kissmatt: cool
Lynn S.M.: Val, I'm all the happier that your story got you a Kerth considering that it is so personal for you. And I am so sorry that it is.
DeadlyChakram: Hiya Kells! Didn't see ya there
NostalgiaKick: Hey Kelly smile
Lynn S.M.: Hi Kelly. Welcome.
DeadlyChakram: Ditto, Val. Glad some brightness could come from such a dark inspiration
Folc4evernaday: Thanks Lynn. I'm still kinda shocked
Kissmatt: I'm here sorta, I'm at a found family dinner grin
Folc4evernaday: Hey Kelly
NostalgiaKick: Lynn- your story had me in floods of tears
Kissmatt: We have 17 ppl and matzo ball chicken soup
Lynn S.M.: NK, it was definitely therapeutic to write. May I belatedly hand you a tissue?
NostalgiaKick: Aww, thanks
Millefeuilles: And very enlightening to read it...
NostalgiaKick: It's not something we've had to deal with yet but it's a potential future that scares me a little
Morgana: Val, this is getting to be a habit!
DeadlyChakram: Lynn's was a dagger in my heart, seriously
NostalgiaKick: Val is going to drown in Kerths smile
Endelda: Congrats again, Val's sweeping the awards this year!
Morgana: But a truly happy one!
Lynn S.M.: Congrats, Val! I'm happy to sat although my story left a lot unresolved, there has been a happy ending in real life. My son is now in a residential school filled with dedicated, caring staff who are trained to work with kids like him; we are both much safer, he's doing well, and our visits are generally filled with positive interactions.
DeadlyChakram: Congrats Val!
Millefeuilles: Congrats, Val! SuperWriter!
CarrieRene: Congrats Val.
NostalgiaKick: That's great Lynn, I was going to ask you how he's doing
DeadlyChakram: I'm so glad, Lynn. May you both be able to breathe easier now
Endelda: That's great Lynn!
CarrieRene: Best Tearjerker was the hardest
DeadlyChakram: *hugs to Lynn*
Morgana: Lynn that is good news for both of you.
Millefeuilles: I'm glad, Lynn... I hope you'll both be doing better.
NostalgiaKick: Congrats Val! That story was rip-your-heart-out sad
Cuidadora: Happy for you, Lynn
Lynn S.M.: NK, I hope you never have to deal with it yourself, but if you do, you've a listening ear here.
NostalgiaKick: whinging
DeadlyChakram: *hugs to Val* I wish your inspiration didn't need to be so true to life
Lynn S.M.: Another five-year story? I second Vicki's sentiment.
Kathryn84: me too.
Millefeuilles: So so I.
Lynn S.M.: I can't even begin to imagine how painful that must have been.
Endelda: Endelda locks Mayson and her lips in a closet
DeadlyChakram: lol
Millefeuilles: LOL!
Cuidadora: LOL!
DeadlyChakram: Congrats to you, Mouse! (Even though you're not here right now)
NostalgiaKick: Aww, pity she had to leave when she did!
Endelda: yay for Mouse!
NostalgiaKick: Congrats Mouse!
Cuidadora: Congrats, Mouse!
Lynn S.M.: Well-done MOUSE!
Morgana: Mayson always has to get in the middle of things!
Millefeuilles: Congrats, Mouse! A lovely story...
CarrieRene: Congrats Mouse
Morgana: The Mouse roars! Lois giving relationship advice? Oh no!
Millefeuilles: Oh, non, NOT Lex!
Morgana: Johnny Corben? Security!
Lynn S.M.: You should know, Lois...
Endelda: The best you can hope for with more criminals is a soft underbelly
nice and vulnerable *most
NostalgiaKick: Yay Ina!
Lynn S.M.: Brava, Cuidadora!
Endelda: Yay Cuidadora!
DeadlyChakram: Congrats, Ina!!!
Folc4evernaday: Congrats Cuidadora!
Millefeuilles: Yay, Ina! CONGRATS!
Lynn S.M.: I love Sister Mary Frances.
CarrieRene: Congratulations Cuidadora
Morgana: Cuidadora! Hey that was a good story. Lois should not have followed Clark!
Millefeuilles: Mary Frances is awesome!
Lynn S.M.: Ooooh... Looking forward to another story about her.
DeadlyChakram: Those Canterbury Tales were so much fun. We should go back to pushing those
Morgana: Another story at the mission? This could be very interesting!
DeadlyChakram: Ooh, yes, do come back, Sister!
Millefeuilles: More Mary Frances! Power to Mary Frances!
Lynn S.M.: As soon as you learn it, you'll be made to forget.
Hmmm... Has anyone rewritten the episode to discuss what would have happened if they hadn't been forced to forget?
DeadlyChakram: *Men in Black show up with a neuralyzer*
Millefeuilles: ROTFL
DeadlyChakram: hehehe
Morgana: DC again!
Endelda: Congrats Vicki!
Folc4evernaday: Congrats Vicki!
NostalgiaKick: Yay Vicki!
Lynn S.M.: Embrace the Kerth, DC smile
Millefeuilles: Yay, Vicky!
NostalgiaKick: LOL
CarrieRene: Like what would happen if Lois had remembered at the end of Tempus Fugitive?
DeadlyChakram: Aww, thanks smile
CarrieRene: Congrats Vicki
Endelda: I'm really loving those stories, I was so happy to see that there's another one coming
DeadlyChakram: Aww thanks. Val is betaing for me and we're hard at work on the next one smile
Lynn S.M.: Carrie, that, too, but I had been thinking about what would have happened if Sam and Ellen Lane had remembered The Secret.
CarrieRene: Oh gotcha in the Toy Story episode, you mean in Season Four
Lynn S.M.: Yup. That's the one.
NostalgiaKick: I'm being squashed by munchkins lol
Lynn S.M.: Cherish the squashing, NK. Those times go by faster than you would imagine.
Morgana: The days are long, but the years are short.
NostalgiaKick: Yeah, Melissa turns 4 tomorrow
She's my 'baby'
Lynn S.M.: And you get a plot bunny, and you get a plot bunny, and you get a plot bunny...
NostalgiaKick: Haha judging by that list, Vicki got lot of plot bunnies
DeadlyChakram: One simple prompt and it gave birth to a litter!
Lynn S.M.: Yay Queenie. Her stories are alway terrific.
DeadlyChakram: Congrats, Queenie!!!!
Endelda: Yay Queenie!
CarrieRene: Congrats Queenie
NostalgiaKick: Well, you know the whole thing about bunnies reproducing Congrats Queenie!
DeadlyChakram: Right?? lol
Millefeuilles: Congrats!
Morgana: Queenie! How cool is that!
Millefeuilles: This one was hilarious!
Patrick West joined the conversation
Lynn S.M.: HI Patrick.
DeadlyChakram: Hi Patrick
Morgana: Hello Patrick
Lynn S.M.: Is Mxy still in the fifth dimension?
Morgana: Let that imp stay there!
Lynn S.M.: Look up in the sky...
Endelda: It's a bird!
CarrieRene: Its a bird. Its a plane
Lynn S.M.: So why was the guy who said that line so excited about what he thought was a bird? Was he an ornithologist? (If so, he was a bad one.)
DeadlyChakram: Yay! Congrats Val!
Morgana: Your cup is running over!
Lynn S.M.: Congrats, Val. You're doing well this evening. smile
Endelda: YAY VAL!!
CarrieRene: Congrats Val
Morgana: This is a happy day!
NostalgiaKick: See? Kerthalanche
DeadlyChakram: Val's gonna need to buy a bigger house for all the awards
Millefeuilles: Wow! congrats, Val!
Lynn S.M.: Not an aVALanche?
Millefeuilles: A mansion!
Morgana: aVALanche! Too Funny!
DeadlyChakram: Bwhahaa!
Cuidadora: CongratCongrats, Val!s!
NostalgiaKick: Joking aside, congratulations Val. It's awesome to see you *finally* taking home those Kerths Hahaha, nice one Lynn
DeadlyChakram: Seriously. Took too long for it to happen
Lynn S.M.: I'm still amazed that my story was nominated for Best OC/SC, since although the story was about Todd, he was barely in it. Thanks to all who voted for it.
For obvious reasons, he's a character near and dear to me.
DeadlyChakram: It was awesome and so memorable
NostalgiaKick: I think your story resonated with a lot of people
Morgana: It really made me think.
NostalgiaKick: There's a lot of us out there that are either directly caring for someone with ASD or have someone they love with ASD
Cuidadora: Absolutely!
Lynn S.M.: Thank you. You're right, NK. ASD is *far* more well-known now than it was when I was growing up.
Morgana, that's one of the best compliments you could give the story. My entire Todd series was definitely designed to be edutainment.
Morgana: About ASD and how families deal with the situation
Lynn S.M.: There's so little realistic fiction about people on the spectrum; I wanted to share a little of what it is really like, at least for me and my family.
CarrieRene: This is what happens when I write a speech while watching MASH
Endelda: lol
Lynn S.M.: Of course, different families will have very different experiences.
One of the best shows ever.
Millefeuilles: Lynn, your stories made me grow as an human being.
Lynn S.M.: I still tear up when I think of "Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Blake's plane was shot down over the Sea of Japan. It spun in. There were no survivors..."
NostalgiaKick: Yup. If you know a person with ASD, you know *one* person with ASD
Lynn S.M.: Or "Did you ever once, ever offer me a lousy cup of coffee?"
Morgana: This is your year DC
CarrieRene: BJ Honeycutt is my favorite character
Lynn S.M.: Wow, Emma, I am truly humbled! That was even better than a Kerth! And speaking of Kerth, congratulations Vicki!
Millefeuilles: no, Lynn, just the truth!
DeadlyChakram: Aww, thanks smile
Lynn S.M.: Exactly, NK.
Millefeuilles: Congrats, Vicky!
Endelda: Congrats Vicki!
Morgana: The characters were solid.
NostalgiaKick: Yay, congrats Vicki!
CarrieRene: Congrats Vicki
Morgana: Grandma Tildy and especially Chen.
DeadlyChakram: Uh oh, I'm seeing in triplicate on stage!
Lynn S.M.: UH, oh. Clones.
Millefeuilles: clones, or alt-Loises?
Endelda: **Endelda hides all the frogs**
Lynn S.M.: Ah. Alts. Much better than clones.
Morgana: Clone Wars
DeadlyChakram: Thanks. It didn't hit me until the end that the name Grandma Tildy came from a book called But No Elephants that I liked as a kid and have now been reading to the girls razz
Morgana: Share the stories of your childhood with your kids. Perfect
CarrieRene: Just like Charlotte's Web. One of my favorites
DeadlyChakram: I kept a whole bunch of books for when I had my own kids. It's nice to be able to share the exact same ones with them
Morgana: Mouse went to the other side? Yikes!
DeadlyChakram: haha
Endelda: We need some extra Clarks in there to balance things out
DeadlyChakram: *pours drinks* If we're seeing that many Loises WITHOUT being tipsy, this should be more fun
Lynn S.M.: And you get a Clark, and you get a Clark, and you get a Clark...
Endelda: wee!
CarrieRene: Extra Clarks is always a good thing
DeadlyChakram: oh yeah!
Lynn S.M.: (But I'll keep a Clark for myself, too. wink ) Yay, Vicki!
Endelda: Congrats again Vicki!
Millefeuilles: Yeah! Hail Vicky!
Morgana: Whee! Another win!
DeadlyChakram: *blushes*
Endelda: a round of Clarks for the house! bottoms up!
CarrieRene: One of my favorites this year... congrats Vicki. I would even read some to my Jakey. (sshh don't tell anyone)
DeadlyChakram: aww thanks
NostalgiaKick: Man, Vicki and Val re killing it this year
Morgana: Cover-up? Oh no, they cannot get into an investigation now! Totally!
Lynn S.M.: Does that mean your presentations are hare-raising?
CarrieRene: Its the year of the V's
Endelda: LOL
Millefeuilles: LOL
NostalgiaKick: I'm lagging badly here btw people, my entire household decided Netflix was their favoured activity this morning
DeadlyChakram: *claps* Congrats, Val!!!
Endelda: Yay Val (again!)
Morgana: The Rules win!
NostalgiaKick: The Rules... ruled?
Millefeuilles: Congrats, Val! The year of the V, indeed!
Lynn S.M.: "V" for "Victory," indeed.
DeadlyChakram: I have a cat to my left (across the room) and a cat to the right (other side of the room) and I can hear them snoring grin
Endelda: Val-ctory
CarrieRene: LOL
Lynn S.M.: Taking cat naps?
NostalgiaKick: Kevin's cooking bacon and it smells so good
CarrieRene: Someone say bacon...
Lynn S.M.: So you're one degree removed from Kevin's Bacon?
DeadlyChakram: They each have an armchair to themselves razz
Nice one, Lynn! Zing!
Morgana: Will somebody please tell my cat to stay off my computer?
CarrieRene: Cat stay off Morgana's computer
NostalgiaKick: Bahahaha, Lynn's on fire with the lines
Lynn S.M.: Cat, chase some other mouse.
DeadlyChakram: Morgana - revoke his/her wifi privileges wink
Morgana: He swatted the monitor! As if I don't have enough technical difficulties tonight!
CarrieRene: My CK says "Hi folc friends"
Morgana: That's what I get for naming him Nimitz..
Lynn S.M.: NK, Kerth ceremonnies always seem to bring out the silliness in me.
Oops, ceremonies
DeadlyChakram: Lynn, go for Comedy next Kerths! grin Man, we got in a LOT of people's heads this year, apparently Yay! Congrats Mille!!!!
Morgana: Mille
Lynn S.M.: Vicki, my fundaising fic that I wrote last year and promised not to post until this coming June definitely has a healthy dose of silliness.
Morgana: Are you still awake?
NostalgiaKick: You and me especially it seems LOL
CarrieRene: Congrats Mille
NostalgiaKick: Yay Mille!
DeadlyChakram: Oh yay! Can't wait, Lynn!
Endelda: Congrats Mille!
Lynn S.M.: Well done, Mille. (I'll refrain from saying "About blooming time" wink )
NostalgiaKick: LOL
CarrieRene: lol
DeadlyChakram: LOL
Folc4evernaday: Congrats Mille!
Cuidadora: Congrats Congrats Mille/Emma!
Millefeuilles: LOL.. Thank you, everyone! This will encourage me to finish the story languishing on my computer
NostalgiaKick: Awesomely well done Mille, you beat out soe really seasoned authors for that award. You should be super proud smile
DeadlyChakram: Oh yay for inspiration!
Millefeuilles: Thank you to my wonderful Betas!
Morgana: No matter how long it takes!
Lynn S.M.: A teaser: Lois writes a Star Trek filk based on an Elvis song. And that's just a small part of it. Please do, Emma. It will have lots of eager readers, I'm sure.
Millefeuilles: I'm going into shock!
NostalgiaKick: Two Kerths in your first year is amazing smile
Millefeuilles: I'm properly amazed!
CarrieRene: Yes it is
Lynn S.M.: Start clearing off a second wall, Val, for all those Kerths. Well done!
Millefeuilles: 2018 is V Year.
NostalgiaKick: Geez Val, you may as well just stay on that stage razz
DeadlyChakram: Congrats Val!
NostalgiaKick: Congrats, Val smile
Millefeuilles: Consider buying another house for these Kerths!
DeadlyChakram: *pulls up special Val seat right on stage*
Morgana: so cool!
NostalgiaKick: It's a good thing these awards are digital or she'd need a shopping trolley to cart them home
Lynn S.M.: You're obviously a versatile writer, Val.
CarrieRene: Congrats Val
Cuidadora: Congrats, Val!
Folc4evernaday: haha so funny Feli. Thanks everyone
Kissmatt: &#128170;**muscle emoji**
CarrieRene: I couldn't remember who Murray was. Thanks.
Lynn S.M.: I wonder how he'd get along with Ralph?
Millefeuilles: an interesting question!
Endelda: Murray has a heart of gold
DeadlyChakram: Now THERE'S a challenge!
CarrieRene: OOh gives me an idea for a story.

Endelda: night Emma!
Millefeuilles: Again, thank you, FoLCs, for everything! I am stunned and grateful beyond words, and I feel quite encouraged by your enjoyment of my stories. Bonne nuit!
Merci!
Lynn S.M.: Oops. "Bonne nuit"? I fear it's been decades since my French classes.. The thought is there, anyway...
Kathryn84: Bonne nuit means good night
DeadlyChakram: And Bon soir is good evening, I think, if I remember my high school French
CarrieRene: Goodnight
DeadlyChakram: Been forever and a day since French class grin
Lynn S.M.: Thanks. I had them reversed in my mind
DeadlyChakram: Congrats, Queenie!
Kathryn84: Yes, bon soir is good evening. I have been relearning basic french a few years ago
Cuidadora: Congrats! Another tie! Yay!
