[00:13] <KarenT> Welcome to the 2012 Kerth Award Ceremony! It's been an exciting year with another round of great stories. It's amazing to think that we're still here after all these years!
[00:14] <KarenT> Though I'm not counting.. it'll make me feel old. ;-) 
[00:14] * amberlea is now known as for_AnnaBtG
[00:14] <KarenT> And hopefully we can get all of these technical difficulties worked out. My mike *is* working, right?
[00:15] <Classicalla> Looking good, amberlea for Anna.
[00:15] <KarenT> But let's go ahead and get things under way
[00:15] <for_AnnaBtG> - Faster to read than a speeding bullet!
[00:15] <KarenT> First up, amber...er, *Anna* is here to present the short story category!
[00:15] <for_AnnaBtG> More powerful in evoking images than a locomotive!
[00:15] <KarenT> (super short. whopps)
[00:15] * LynnSM has joined #kerthawards
[00:16] <for_AnnaBtG> Able to leap tall plot-holes in a single bound!

[00:16] <for_AnnaBtG> It's a bird!
[00:16] <for_AnnaBtG> It's a plane!
[00:16] <for_AnnaBtG> No, it‚Äôs the 2012 Best Super Short Story!
[00:16] <for_AnnaBtG> - Oh, really? Which one is it?
[00:17] <for_AnnaBtG> - Hmm, I couldn‚Äôt see very well, it was so high up there, among all the top-notch stories that have been won Kerths throughout the years!

[00:27] <AlishaK2> Wow - is Bob not here?
[00:27] * KarenT checks.. nt that I can tell?
[00:27] <AlishaK2> I think this happened to me last year as well...
[00:28] <AlishaK2> Thank you everyone who nominated & voted for mine & Bob's stories
[00:28] <AlishaK2> I was hoping to sit quietly in the corner tonight so I don't have much to say,
[00:28] <AlishaK2> but I know I've been rather AWOL from FoLCdom for a while
[00:29] <AlishaK2> so it means a lot more to even be nominated this year.
[00:29] * pamela__ has quit IRC (Signed off)
[00:29] <AlishaK2> Thanks again guys - and especially Lynn who gave me the prompts for the story.

[00:31] <amberlea> Once upon a time, in a land far far away, there was a library.  
[00:31] <amberlea> The shelves of this library contained many different stories.  
[00:31] <amberlea> All of the stories featured the favorite characters of the land, but they all differed in length.  
[00:31] <amberlea> One day, Goldifolc walked in to the library.  
[00:32] * ChiefPam has joined #kerthawards
[00:32] <amberlea> She perused the shelves for a while.
[00:32] * KarenT sets mode: -v AlishaK2
[00:32] <amberlea> Stopping at one section, she noted the very wide spines of the books.  
[00:33] <amberlea> "These stories are too long," said Goldifolc.  
[00:33] <amberlea> She moved on to the next shelf, where the books were no thicker than a sheet of paper.
[00:33] <amberlea> "Oh, these stories are much too short for me today."
[00:33] <amberlea> At the next shelf, the books were a little longer.
[00:34] <amberlea> "That's a little better," said Goldifolc, "but still not quite long enough."  
[00:34] <amberlea> Finally, she arrived at the shelf with stories that were not too long and not too short.  
[00:35] <amberlea> "This is just right!" she exclaimed. 
[00:35] <amberlea> "Just what I wanted, a Mid-Length Story!"
[00:36] <amberlea> And the nominees are:
[00:36] <amberlea> A Father's Kryptonite by Anti-Kryptonite
[00:36] <amberlea> Asking Lois Out by Female Hawk
[00:36] <amberlea> Clarkus Maximus by Deadly Chakram
[00:36] <amberlea> The Inconveniences of Doing Superman's Laundry by Nan Smith
[00:36] <amberlea> With a Source by Female Hawk
[00:37] <amberlea> And the winner is...
[00:37] <amberlea> The Inconveniences of Doing Superman's Laundry by Nan Smith!
[00:37] * KarenT sets mode: +v hachiban
[00:37] <amberlea> Congratulations Nan!
[00:39] <hachiban> II can't believe it!
[00:39] <Classicalla> Congratulations, Nan!!
[00:39] <hachiban> OOne story the whole year, and it actually won? Considering the competition I'm completely stunned!
[00:41] <hachiban> TThank you to everyone who liked my little contribution to L and C this year. I'm honored.
[00:42] <hachiban> TThank you very much, everyone.
[00:43] <amberlea> And now, a word from our sponsors.
[00:43] <hachiban> TThat's all, folks. I didn't expect to win, so I didn't have any prepared speeches.
[00:43] * amberlea is now known as for_Virginia
[00:43] <for_Virginia> Does your boyfriend seem to have multiple personalities and you can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs coming or going?  
[00:44] <for_Virginia> Send him to me*, Madame Moresca!  
[00:44] * KarenT sets mode: -v hachiban
[00:44] <for_Virginia> But you‚Äôll have to make the choice:  do you want the exciting hero or the dependable family man?   
[00:44] <for_Virginia> Returns are double the cost.
[00:44] <for_Virginia> *This service does not work on women stolen through dimensional time-windows, who now think they are housewives to plumbers.  
[00:45] <for_Virginia> You‚Äôre on your own for those.

[00:45] * for_Virginia is now known as amberlea
[00:45] <amberlea> Welcome back to the 2012 Kerth Awards Ceremony!
[00:46] <amberlea> After an exciting start to the evening (or morning, or middle of the night, as it were), we're on to our fourth award.
[00:47] <KarenT> Just an announcement regarding the smaller certificates... I'll be asking for email addresses instead of sending them via IRC. I guess I have some difficulties here!
[00:47] * KarenT sets mode: +v Corrina
[00:48] <Corrina> The next category is for the Best Waffy Story.
[00:48] <Corrina> This is where we show our appreciation for stories with sweetly brilliant B Plot and lots of awww moments between Lois and Clark.
[00:49] <Corrina> These stories don't need villians or a complicated plot.  They don't need a case for Lois and Clark to chase down.  They don't need a mystery for them to solve.
[00:50] <Corrina> All they need is a happy ending with Lois and Clark together.
[00:50] <Corrina> And everyone of these stories delivered wonderfully!
[00:50] * Mouserocks has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[00:50] <Corrina> First up is Sue's delightful Christmas fic, 'All I Want (For Christmas)'.  Lois gives Clark the gift he will treasure forever - a kiss under the mistletoe.
[00:51] <Corrina> Alisha's (pertinently named ;) ) 'An Award Winning Story' is next.  It's Kerth night, and Clark has been nominated.  Lois accompanies him - not as his date, but as his raisin.
[00:51] <Corrina> Anti-Kryptonite wrote a beautiful series on the senses, and 'First Touch' is our next nomination.  Lois thinks about the three men in her life and realises she fell in love with Clark at first touch.
[00:52] <Corrina> 'No Greater Love' by Happy Girl is written as two sides of one story and deals with the consequences of Clark freezing Lois.  The story ends with a gentle revelation that grows out of forgiveness and deeper understanding.
[00:52] <Corrina> Bob's Valentine's Day fairy tale, 'Save This Dance For Me', is next.  Lois and Clark meet and fall in love.  Then Lois discovers that Clark is the one man who makes it possible to start an evening in Metropolis and finish it with a Parisian sunrise!
[00:52] * Mouserocks has joined #kerthawards
[00:53] <Corrina> Our final nomination is 'The Ring' by Morgana, a sweet story which sees Clark facing the tricky task of choosing a ring that adequately represents his feelings for Lois.  He finds exactly the right one with a perfect stone.  He proposes.  But will she accept?
[00:53] <Corrina> And the winner is ...
[00:53] <Corrina> We have another tie!!!
[00:54] <Corrina> So our first winner is ...
[00:54] [KarenT:#kerthawards SOUND]
[00:54] <Corrina> All I Want (for Christmas) by Sue S
[00:54] <Corrina> And ...
[00:55] [KarenT:#kerthawards SOUND]
[00:55] <Corrina> An Award Winning Story by Alisha Knight
[00:55] * KarenT sets mode: +v AlishaK2
[00:55] <Corrina> Congratulations to both ladies!
[00:55] <AlishaK2> Don't tell me, Sue isn't here either, right?
[00:55] <KarenT> nope
[00:56] <KarenT> doesn't look like it
[00:56] <AlishaK2> Wow.
[00:56] <AlishaK2> To win two awards with one story is amazing
[00:57] <AlishaK2> To tie with such great writers as well is just... I'm speechless.
[00:57] <AlishaK2> And to win one for WaFFY, I never would have guessed that!
[00:57] <AlishaK2> Thank you so much again, everyone, and I'm sure Sue thanks you all too.
[00:58] <KarenT> Next up... is..
[00:59] <KarenT> um. Best Comedy

[00:59] * Becky__ has joined #kerthawards
[00:59] <for_AnnaBtG> So guys, you might have noticed I haven‚Äôt been very much into fandom for the past few years.
[00:59] <for_AnnaBtG> It‚Äôs a very sad story, actually. 
[00:59] <for_AnnaBtG> A tragic succession of unfortunate events and depressive situations, to be more exact.
[00:59] <for_AnnaBtG> *cue sad violin music*
[01:00] <for_AnnaBtG> You see, I became involved with this guy, who turned out to be a complete idiot who abused me, and he made me withdraw into myself and stifled my creative spirit.
[01:00] <for_AnnaBtG> Then there was all the stress of my university studies, of course. 
[01:00] <for_AnnaBtG> Do you know how hard it is to write a proper dissertation?
[01:00] <for_AnnaBtG> And now?
[01:00] <for_AnnaBtG>  I‚Äôm unemployed, living in a country with many financial struggles, my boyfriend isn‚Äôt attentive enough and on top of that ‚Äì
[01:00] <for_AnnaBtG> *record scratching*
[01:01] <for_AnnaBtG> Wait, nobody cares about that, right?
[01:01] <for_AnnaBtG> Okay, let me tell you a funny story.
[01:01] <for_AnnaBtG> It should cheer you up a little.
[01:01] <for_AnnaBtG> Well, you see, there was this one time that Clark Kent turned into a dog, then went to visit Lois.
[01:01] <for_AnnaBtG> She had no idea what had happened. 
[01:02] <for_AnnaBtG> It was hilarious.
[01:02] <for_AnnaBtG> This other time, the mayor of Metropolis wanted to kick Superman‚Äôs descendants out of Metropolis. 
[01:02] <for_AnnaBtG> But one of the grandsons showed him who was boss!
[01:02] <for_AnnaBtG> Oh, I remembered another one. 
[01:02] <for_AnnaBtG> Clark once decided to ask Lois out. 
[01:03] <for_AnnaBtG> No, really, he did. 
[01:03] <for_AnnaBtG> But everything just kept coming in the way. 
[01:03] <for_AnnaBtG> You know how these things are, poor guy can never get a break.
[01:03] <for_AnnaBtG> Like that other time, where everything he had to do was overwhelming him, and he kept forgetting things, like the fact that Mayson was waiting for him?
[01:03] <for_AnnaBtG> Maybe you‚Äôd like a funny story about how funny stories are written? 
[01:04] <for_AnnaBtG> The struggle with a Muse that keeps suggesting weird ideas about fanfics and won‚Äôt budge without a little bit of Super help?
[01:04] <for_AnnaBtG> ‚Ä¶Okay, you got me. 
[01:04] <for_AnnaBtG> None of these stories are mine. 
[01:04] <for_AnnaBtG> They‚Äôre actually the nominees for the Best Comedy Kerth award:
[01:04] <for_AnnaBtG> A (Super) Brief Paws in the Heroic Life of Clark Kent by D√©j√† vu, 
[01:04] <for_AnnaBtG> Argument that Founded Utopia by Mary Potts,
[01:05] <for_AnnaBtG> Asking Lois Out by Female Hawk,
[01:05] <for_AnnaBtG> The Absent-Minded Superhero by Lois_Lane_Fan,
[01:05] <for_AnnaBtG> and With Apologies to Female Hawk by Lynn S. M.
[01:05] <for_AnnaBtG> Which one did you like best, though?
[01:05] <for_AnnaBtG> I hear you voted, and the results are in an envelope I‚Äôm about to receive...
[01:05] <for_AnnaBtG> Okay, got it! So, the winner is:

[01:07] <Corrina> Ah ... thank you
[01:07] <Corrina> I'm in shock, because I like writing drama, with perhaps a dash of WAFF ...
[01:07] <Corrina> But comedy?
[01:08] <Corrina> Loud (and embarrassing gulp)
[01:08] <Corrina> So ... onto business ...
[01:09] <Corrina> I must thank my wonderful BRs ...
[01:09] <Corrina> Iolanthe ... who is a treasure
[01:09] <Corrina> Vicki who kindly made her BR debut on this story
[01:10] <Corrina> And Lynn who suffered through this fic when it had a different ending and wasn't fit to be read by anyone
[01:10] <Corrina> Thanks also to the FOLCs who read the story, gave greatly encouraging FDK, and inspire me to keep writing
[01:11] <Corrina> And thanks for voting for this fic!!

[01:13] <for_Michael> Good. It‚Äôs working.
[01:13] <for_Michael> So, I‚Äôm happy to present this year‚Äôs Best Revelation.
[01:14] <for_Michael> And talking about revelations, did you guys notice how many evil masterminds in the recent decades have used proxies when showing up in public? 
[01:14] <for_Michael> Just look at Lex Luthor Jr.
[01:14] <for_Michael> Huh?
[01:14] <for_Michael> What do you mean by ‚Äòthis isn‚Äôt the revelation you‚Äôre looking for‚Äô?
[01:14] <for_Michael> Oh. Duh!
[01:15] <for_Michael> All you care about is when Lois learns that her one true love is also subbing as her Hicksville partner?
[01:15] <for_Michael> Yeah, okay. 
[01:15] <for_Michael>  I get that.
[01:15] * AMCiotola has joined #kerthawards
[01:15] <for_Michael> And isn‚Äôt it a grand spectacle when Lois learns the truth?
[01:16] <for_Michael> The drama.
[01:16] <for_Michael> The despair.
[01:16] <for_Michael> The tears.
[01:16] <for_Michael> Oh, and once Clark‚Äôs done crying, Lois gets to take him home and put him into bed.
[01:16] <for_Michael> But that‚Äôs a story for another kind of fic.
[01:17] <for_Michael> Tonight we‚Äôre here to honor the authors who wrote one of the grand staples of LnC fanfic - The Revelation!
[01:17] <for_Michael> And the contestants are:
[01:18] <for_Michael> * And the Truth Will Set You... by Bartholomew, Bob
[01:18] <for_Michael> * And Then There Was Light by Anti Kryptonite
[01:18] <for_Michael> * Just Say My Name, Lois by Deadly Chakram
[01:18] <for_Michael> * Just Say My Name, Clark by Deadly Chakram
[01:18] * CarolM has joined #kerthawards
[01:18] <for_Michael> * The Other Shoe by Sue S
[01:19] <for_Michael> * The Yodeler's Song by Virginia R.
[01:19] <for_Michael> And this year‚Äôs Kerth award for the best revelation in a LnC fanfic goes to...
[01:19] * for_Michael goes hunting for envelope...
[01:20] <for_Michael> Hmm... No, that‚Äôs Best Episode Adaptation...
[01:20] <for_Michael> Aaahhhh! There it is.

[01:21] <for_Michael> Congratulations Bob and Anti-K!
[01:22] <Classicalla> Congrats to Bob and Anti-K!!
[01:22] <AntiKryptoni> Oh, wow. I doubt that anyone could reliably count just exactly how many revelation stories have been written. There are infinite ways the Secret could be exposed‚Äîto Lois, to Clark‚Äôs friends, to the world‚Äîand I‚Äôm sure that a large percentage of those possibilities have been written about at one time or another. Yet this revelation keeps us each entranced, keeps us reading more 
[01:22] <AntiKryptoni> stories about how people connect Superman to Clark Kent, and inspired me to write one myself. I know this revelation doesn‚Äôt equal THE Revelation, but I just want to let you all in on my own secret‚ÄîI‚Äôm over the moon even without Superman‚Äôs flight to receive this award! Thanks to everyone who helped with this story‚ÄîAnonpip, DW, and Morgana especially, and to Iolanthe who edited

[01:30] <for_Michael> Well, I guess the show‚Äôs authors must feel really, really complimented.
[01:30] <for_Michael> And the Episode Adaptation surely is the greatest homage of them all.
[01:30] <for_Michael> Well, either that, or the episode really, really needed fixing ;)
[01:31] <for_Michael> Fortunately for us though, our authors are true magicians when it comes to shining a spotlight at the inner workings of our heroes, or simply finding new and ingenious ways of getting them to stop moping (a naked Lois will do that to a Clark) or even when it comes to getting rid of some garbage.
[01:31] <for_Michael> Hey, it‚Äôs not Lois‚Äôs fault that her garbage was stolen!
[01:32] <for_Michael> So, without *that* much more ado, this year‚Äôs contenders for the best Episode Adaptation are:
[01:32] <for_Michael> * Blind (Super)Man's Bluff by ML Thompson
[01:32] <for_Michael> * A Father's Kryptonite by Anti-Kryptonite
[01:32] <for_Michael> * The Inconveniences of Doing Superman's Laundry by Smith, Nan
[01:33] <for_Michael> * Lighter Than Air, Better Than Gravity by Anti-Kryptonite
[01:33] <for_Michael> * What Is Eternal? by Deadly Chakram
[01:33] * for_Michael pulls out correct envelope
[01:33] <for_Michael> And the Kerth award goes to...
[01:33] <for_Michael> Lois Lane?
[01:34] <for_Michael> Hey, who let Kyle Griffin handle the envelopes?
[01:34] * for_Michael flips card over
[01:34] <for_Michael> And the Kerth award goes to...
[01:34] <for_Michael> Blind (Super) Man's Bluff by ML Thompson
[01:35] <for_Michael> Congratulations!
[01:35] <Classicalla> Congratulations!  
[01:35] * for_Michael waves goodnight to audience
[01:35] * for_Michael is now known as amberlea
[01:36] <KarenT> I guess ML isn't here tonight, but I'm sure she'll be tickled to find out that she won!
[01:38] <amberlea> And now, the Kerth award presentation for Best Drama.
[01:39] <Classicalla> And I have the honor of presenting that category.
[01:39] <Classicalla> Best Drama Stories focus on a series of exciting or suspenseful events.  Stories can be similar in tone and balance to the show‚Äôs episodes, or tackle a more serious subject matter, and will generally, though not always, contain a significant A-Plot.  There are no size restrictions.
[01:40] <Classicalla> And this year, we have some great stories!
[01:40] <Classicalla> The nominees are:
[01:41] <Classicalla> And Then There Was Light by Anti-Kryptonite.
[01:41] <Classicalla> Thinking he was responsible for the heat-wave, Superman left, taking Clark with him. Now, two months later, Lois is still struggling to move on alone without both men, a feat made harder when she's kidnapped by Luthor and thrown in a cell with...Clark?
[01:41] <Classicalla> Distraught ‚Äì Mouserocks
[01:42] <Classicalla> "Distraught" takes place in a world where Clark lost Lois in childbirth, along with his son, and how he handles it emotionally and physically six months later upon returning to work. Mouserocks describes this as a very dark story.
[01:42] <Classicalla> Everywhere - Stopquitdont 
[01:42] <Classicalla> When Clark decides to end his relationship with Lois for her own good, she breaks. Deciding that she can't handle working with Clark at the Daily Planet anymore, she sets out to collect stories from all over the world. In doing so, she learns that she can't stop loving Clark. She takes him "everywhere."
[01:42] <Classicalla> The Other Shoe - Sue S
[01:43] <Classicalla> Lois and Clark dating? Check. Lois being plucky and resourceful? You betcha. Clark testing the ethical limits of his super abilities? In big and little ways. Flirting? Uh-huh. Kissing? Sure! Action on a couch? Oh, baby, yes. Angst? Bring it! This story has a little bit of everything but an A-plot. Well, okay, maybe there's a tiny hint of one, but it's more decorative than functional.
[01:43] <Classicalla> The Wonder of Love - Terry Leatherwood
[01:43] <Classicalla> On their fifth anniversary, Clark and Lois find their marriage under attack from both without and within. External events put doubts in Lois' mind about whether she should really be Superman's wife. And another woman is trying to force a wedge between them -- but not just with her feminine wiles.
[01:43] <Classicalla> Some really great stories, eh?  
[01:44] * Classicalla fumbles with envelope.
[01:44] <Classicalla> And...  
[01:44] <Classicalla> The winner is:
[01:44] <Classicalla> And Then There Was Light - Anti-Kryptonite
[01:44] <Classicalla> Congratulations!!
[01:45] <Classicalla> Speech!  Speech!
[01:46] * KarenT sets mode: +v AntiKryptoni
[01:46] <AntiKryptoni> Winning an award for the Best Drama category, I really feel like this little acceptance speech should encapsulate all the things that make drama good--a little bit of comedy, a lot of romance, enough angst to keep people asking for the next chapter--but unfortunately, I just have never been able to write SHORT. :) But here‚Äôs a little effort: To my beta-readers go the suspense because 
[01:46] <AntiKryptoni> they‚Äôre the ones who had to wait between chapters. To my family goes the comedy because they just chuckle and smile when I make yet another L&C reference at the dinner table. To the amazing, can‚Äôt-be-appreciated-enough people who give feedback goes the love because without your support I‚Äôd probably never be bold enough to post anything. And to everyone who voted, I send the warmest 
[01:46] <AntiKryptoni> thank you as an ending to this speech. Thanks!
[01:48] <amberlea> Clark walked in to the Daily Planet.  
[01:48] <amberlea> He met Lois.
[01:49] <amberlea> Lois said, "Clark, I love you!"
[01:49] <amberlea> Clark said, "Lois, I have these cool superpowers."
[01:49] <amberlea> Lois said, "Great, we'll call you Superman!"
[01:50] <amberlea> Perry said, "Clark, you're hired."
[01:50] <amberlea> The End.
[01:50] <amberlea> This little vignette, of course, would never be considered for the best relationship category.
[01:50] <amberlea> The following stories, however, are excellent at taking us through the ups and downs of the "love triangle built for two" that we never grow tired of reading about.
[01:51] <amberlea> And the nominees are:
[01:51] <amberlea> And the Truth Will Set You... by Bob Bartholomew
[01:51] <amberlea> Chocolate Lab by IolantheAlias
[01:51] <amberlea> Green Eyed Monster by Virginia
[01:51] <amberlea> Mr. and Mrs. Kent by Mozartmaid
[01:51] <amberlea> Trusting Me, Trusting You by Female Hawk
[01:52] <amberlea> And the winner is...
[01:52] <amberlea> Trusting Me, Trusting You by Female Hawk!
[01:52] * KarenT sets mode: -v AntiKryptoni
[01:52] <Classicalla> Congratulations, Female Hawk!
[01:52] * KarenT sets mode: +v Corrina
[01:53] <Corrina> Thanks, everyone!
[01:54] <Corrina> TMTY took nine months of my life to write, but the thing I remember most about that time is the incredible support and enthusiasm from FOLCs as I rolled it out part by part
[01:55] <Corrina> As with all stories, there were times when I seemed to hit a roadblock, but I'd go back, re-read some of the amazing FDK, and keep writing.
[01:55] <Corrina> So, to those who followed along, this is your award, too.
[01:56] <Corrina> And huge thanks to my three wonderful BRs - Iolanthe, Deja Vu, and Lynn!
[01:56] <Corrina> And lastly, thanks to everyone who voted!
[01:58] <amberlea> Yet another exciting set of awards has been presented...the suspense is building as we get closer to the big finale!
[01:58] <amberlea> You know, the swimsuit competition!
[01:58] <amberlea> Oh wait, sorry.

[02:02] <amberlea> And we're back!
[02:02] <Classicalla> Hello.
[02:02] * Becky__ has joined #kerthawards
[02:03] * VirginiaR has joined #kerthawards
[02:03] <Classicalla> I'm back to present The Best Alternate Universe / Elseworlds award.
[02:04] <Classicalla> These stories Generation stories feature parallel universes (including Alt World that was introduced on the show), or stories in which the author has made major changes as time, place and / or nature of the characters) before the point where the series started in the Pilot.  
[02:04] <Classicalla> The first story is a ficathon story about a down-and-out Alt-Clark who gets tossed unexpectedly into a world where Superman is still a secret identity, where he works side-by-side with Lois Lane and where his parents are alive. But will it last?
[02:05] <Classicalla> Down the Rabbit Hole by Mozartmaid 
[02:06] <Classicalla> The next story has a mostly romance storyline that takes place concurrently with the entire fourth season and explains who the baby is, where it came from, what happens after the season 4 finale, as well as the alternate dimension's Clark's search and discovery his Lois. In other words, canon Lois and Clark make love before he leaves for New Krypton. Lois discovers six weeks later she is 
[02:06] <Classicalla> pregnant and cursed. H.G. Wells convinces her to go to the alt-dimension until he can find a solution to the curse.
[02:06] * VirginiaR has quit IRC (Signed off)
[02:06] <Classicalla> Mr. and Mrs. Kent by Mozartmaid  
[02:07] * KenJ has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[02:07] <Classicalla> Next up is a story where Clark Kent has been trapped in a cell for seven years. Government agent Lois Lane is tormented by grief and traumatic memories. She is assigned to guard the alien prisoner, and together, Lois and Clark find the strength to travel the long journey to healing, trust, love, and freedom.  Oh, the angst.
[02:07] <Classicalla> Trusting Me, Trusting You by Female Hawk
[02:08] <Classicalla> Oh, dear.  I can't read anymore, can I??  
[02:08] <Classicalla> Let's see now.  The second story (again) is a mostly romance storyline that takes place concurrently with the entire fourth season, explains who the baby is, where it came from, what happens after the season 4 finale, as well as the alternate dimension's Clark's search and discovery his Lois. In other words, canon Lois and Clark make love before he leaves for New Krypton. Lois discovers 
[02:08] <Classicalla> six weeks later she is pregnant and cursed. H.G. Wells convinces her to go to the alt-dimension until he can find a solution to the curse.
[02:09] <Classicalla> And that story is Missing Lois - VirginiaR
[02:09] <Classicalla> Smacking is allowed, Virginia.
[02:09] <Classicalla> I got Female Hawk's story correct.  
[02:10] <Classicalla> And the next story is about secrets.  Lois and Clark both have their secrets. Can one night of passion be enough to bring them together -- even if Lois happens to be an assassin?
[02:10] <Classicalla> Now that's the one that belongs to Mozartmaid.  Mr. and Mrs. Kent 
[02:11] * Dernit has quit IRC (Signed off)
[02:11] <Classicalla> Okay, and finally we have another ficathon 2011 story that is set two weeks after Clark arrived in Metropolis and assumes that the newbie from Kansas was not immediately paired with the star reporter, Lois Lane. In fact, they had very little to do with each other, until...
[02:11] <Classicalla> And that's With a Source - Female Hawk
[02:12] <Classicalla> I blame it all on a migraine!  But I'll get the winner right!!!
[02:12] * Mouserocks has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[02:12] <Classicalla> Congratulations!!!  Corrina...
[02:13] <Corrina> Thanks again.
[02:14] <Corrina> I know the alt universe I started with was dark and horrible, but I always saw this story as a testament to the power of love
[02:14] * VirginiaR has joined #kerthawards
[02:14] <Corrina> No matter how strong the forces of evil and hatred and bigotry, love and forgiveness will prevail
[02:15] <Corrina> And that's what I was trying to say.
[02:15] <Corrina> It took me nearly 400 000 words to say it!
[02:15] <Corrina> So thanks to those who kept reading despite the start.  I really appreciated that.
[02:16] <Corrina> Thanks to everyone who voted!  I'm honoured to win amongst such great stories.
[02:17] <amberlea> Congratulations Corrina!
[02:17] <amberlea> And now, presenting Best Original/Supporting Character is Iolanthe!
[02:18] * amberlea sets mode: +v IolantheAlia
[02:18] <IolantheAlia> Hello everyone!
[02:18] * amberlea sets mode: -v Corrina
[02:18] <IolantheAlia> The next category is for the Best Original or Supporting Character, and as usual, it‚Äôll be a tough decision by our voters.   FoLCs are worldwide, and it‚Äôs fortunate that our voters don‚Äôt have to gather in one location to cast their votes.
[02:19] <IolantheAlia> Speaking as one of the voters, I had to take an airline flight recently.   I came across an odd sight ‚Äì a vulture carrying two dead raccoons tried to get on the airplane.
[02:19] <IolantheAlia> Fortunately, the flight attendant informed him that only one carrion was allowed per passenger.  /rim shot/
[02:20] <IolantheAlia> OK, now that you‚Äôre done groaning, I‚Äôll present the nominees in alphabetical order by title of the fic.  
[02:20] * mib_zu08d7 has joined #kerthawards
[02:20] <IolantheAlia> Our first nominee comes from ML Thompson‚Äôs fic, ‚ÄúBlind (Super)Man‚Äôs Bluff‚Äù.  He is ‚Ä¶drumroll‚Ä¶ an original character‚Ä¶ second drumroll‚Ä¶. Let‚Äôs hear applause for SHADOW THE DOG!  
[02:21] * Becky__ has quit IRC (Signed off)
[02:21] * mib_zu08d7 has quit IRC (Signed off)
[02:21] <IolantheAlia> As you recall, in this fic, Clark lost his sight due to evil machinations of Dr. Leit, and Shadow became his Seeing Eye dog.  Shadow‚Äôs devotion is the stuff of legend, and when Clark regains his sight (sorry to spoil it for those who haven‚Äôt read the fic), Shadow stays with Clark and Lois.  
[02:22] <IolantheAlia> Speaking of dogs, I once knew a man who had a dog with no legs, named Cigarette.  
[02:22] <IolantheAlia> Everyday he took it out for a drag.  
[02:22] <IolantheAlia> And, speaking of that, those legless dogs are uncommon.  Where do you find a dog with no legs?
[02:22] * mib_b2puw6 has joined #kerthawards
[02:23] <IolantheAlia> Right where you left him.  /rim shot again/
[02:23] * mib_074hjc has quit IRC (Signed off)
[02:23] <IolantheAlia> OK, I know you almost threw a rock at your screen there, so let‚Äôs move on to our next nominee.
[02:24] * mib_b2puw6 has quit IRC (Signed off)
[02:24] <IolantheAlia> Lynn SM wrote a fic, ‚ÄúGofer No More‚Äù, which explained the strange metamorphosis of JIMMY OLSEN (our nominee) between Season One and Season Two.  Not wanting to give too much away, I‚Äôll just say that it involves an egg allergy and soul transfer.  After you read this, you‚Äôll understand why Jimmy lost about a foot of height and changed his hair color.  
[02:24] * mib_mhvex8 has joined #kerthawards
[02:24] <IolantheAlia> Now, (unrelated to the fic) we know Jimmy has a hard time finding romance.  Do you know why he took a prune out for the evening?
[02:25] <IolantheAlia> Because he couldn‚Äôt get a date.  
[02:26] <IolantheAlia> When I saw the change between Season One Jimmy and Season Two Jimmy, I wondered if I needed my vision checked.  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt investigate my ophthalmologist‚Äôs bona fides.  
[02:27] <IolantheAlia> I thought I saw an eye doctor on an Alaskan island, but he turned out to be an optical Aleutian.
[02:27] <IolantheAlia> OK, moving on to our next nominee‚Ä¶.
[02:28] <IolantheAlia> OK, moving on to our next nominee‚Ä¶.
[02:28] <IolantheAlia> Terry Leatherwood gave us a new take on one of the DC Universe‚Äôs major characters, WONDER WOMAN.  Unfortunately, this WW is not the morally upright Amazon we know and love.  No, in Terry‚Äôs fic, Diana wants a husband, and the only man who will do is, of course, Superman.  She‚Äôs willing to go to any lengths to get her man.    
[02:28] <IolantheAlia> Including ‚Äúdealing with‚Äù an inconvenient wife, Lois Lane.  
[02:29] <IolantheAlia> I don‚Äôt want to spoil it, so you‚Äôll have to read the fic to find out how the combat-to-the-death between Lois and WW works out.   Let‚Äôs just say that a comic book illustrator would absolutely love drawing this.  (Warning:  The fic is rated PG-13 for sexuality and violence.)  
[02:29] <IolantheAlia> You know, speaking of ratings, my local symphony orchestra just had their TV contract cancelled.  Too much sax and violins.  
[02:30] <IolantheAlia> Getting back to the Amazons of Paradise Island, it‚Äôs a good thing they don‚Äôt believe in the weapons of man‚Äôs world.  In our world, a grenade thrown into a French kitchen would result in Linoleum Blownapart.  
[02:30] <IolantheAlia> Of course, based on Wonder Woman‚Äôs classic costume, the Amazons don‚Äôt believe in a lot of clothing, either.  It reminds me of the hole found in the nudist-camp wall ‚Äì the police are looking into it. 
[02:31] <IolantheAlia> OK, OK, OK‚Ä¶ before I‚Äôm driven off with torches by the angry mob, let me present our last nominee:
[02:31] <IolantheAlia> PERRY WHITE in Virginia R‚Äôs fic, ‚ÄúThe Yodeler‚Äôs Song‚Äù, lets us (and only us) know that he figured out Clark‚Äôs secret quite some time ago.  As we all know, Perry didn‚Äôt become the Editor In Chief of the Daily Planet because he could yodel
[02:31] <IolantheAlia> Perry tells us the clues that led him to his knowledge.  All we can do is hope that nobody else is as perspicacious! 
[02:32] <IolantheAlia> Now, of course we know Perry has a weekly poker game.  And sometimes he needs another player (aka ‚Äúfresh meat‚Äù).  Even Clark played poker with Perry at least once.  But why didn‚Äôt the pirate play poker?
[02:32] <IolantheAlia> He was sitting on the deck.
[02:33] <IolantheAlia> And why do cats dislike flying saucers?
[02:33] <IolantheAlia> Because it‚Äôs impossible for them to reach the milk. 
[02:33] <IolantheAlia> I hope you‚Äôre ready for the winner.  Again, our nominees for Best Original/Supporting Character are as follows:
[02:34] <IolantheAlia> Blind Super(Man‚Äôs) Bluff by ML Thompson ‚Äì SHADOW THE DOG
[02:34] <IolantheAlia> Gofer No More? By Lynn SM ‚Äì JIMMY OLSEN (BOTH VERSIONS)
[02:34] <IolantheAlia> The Wonder of Love by Terry Leatherwood ‚Äì WONDER WOMAN
[02:34] <IolantheAlia> The Yodeler‚Äôs Song by Virginia R ‚Äì PERRY WHITE
[02:35] <IolantheAlia> And the winner is‚Ä¶ (drum roll)‚Ä¶ 
[02:35] <IolantheAlia> SHADOW THE DOG from Blind (Super)Man‚Äôs Bluff by ML Thompson!
[02:36] <Classicalla> Congratulations, ML!!
[02:36] <amberlea> Congrats ML!
[02:37] <amberlea> For our next category, a tradition continues.
[02:37] * amberlea sets mode: +v LynnSM
[02:37] * amberlea sets mode: +v mozartmaid
[02:37] <LynnSM> It is a Kerth Awards Ceremony tradition that the winner of the award for the Best New Author be announced by the previous year's winner(s). The caliber of this year's nominees is truly outstanding; it will be an honour to pass the torch along to whomever the winner may be.
[02:37] <LynnSM> This year, we have two nominees: Anti-Kryptonite and Deadly Chakram. Coincidentally enough, there were two winners of the BNA last year: MozartMaid and myself. We will each be discussing the writings of one of the nominees.  MozartMaid will have the pleasure of describing Deadly Chakram's writings.
[02:37] * amberlea sets mode: -v IolantheAlia
[02:38] <LynnSM> I am delighted to be able to talk about Anti-Kryptonite's works. Her love of our favourite show shines through her stories, and she brings a fresh perspective to a show that has been out of production for decades.  From the moment she posted her debut story, "A Father's Kryptonite," on lcficmbs, her writings have taken the board by storm.
[02:38] <LynnSM> If you find yourself drawn to contemplative stories, then you should definitely try some of Anti-Kryptonite's works. Several of her stories, including her "Senses" series, plumb the depths of isolated moments. Anti-Kryptonite has also proven herself adept at writing action scenes, as well;  some scenes from "And then There Was Light" spring to mind.
[02:38] <LynnSM> But of course Anti-Kryptonite is not the only individual nominated for Best New Author this year. The stories written by both of  2011's new author nominees make a tremendous and a welcome addition to the body of L&C fanfic. The stories range from heart-rending to heart-warming, from plot-intense to introspective to just plain fluff.
[02:39] <LynnSM> MozartMaid, what are your thoughts on Deadly Chakram's writing?
[02:39] <mozartmaid> Deadly Chakram delves into the heart of the matter, stirring the reader's emotions and drawing our favorite characters with warmth and charm, adding her own deft touch. Her pair of nominated stories, "Just say my name, Lois" and "Just say my name, Clark" draw out both the revelation of Lois and Clark's feelings for each other and truth about Superman in such simple and touching ways. She 
[02:39] <mozartmaid> uses well known elements of the show in subtle and new ways, making the love of Lois and Clark as classic as, well, Lois' love of chocolate.
[02:39] <mozartmaid> Her story "Snowbound," which was just recently added to the archive, is one of the most waffy and enjoyable fics I've read in a long time!
[02:40] <mozartmaid> She's also not afraid of mixing it up -- like in her other nominated story, "Clarxus Maximus," in which our favorite characters get sent to the land of Xena, Warrior Princess, thanks to a certain time-traveling villain.
[02:40] <mozartmaid> So, it's quite a competition between these two fantastic authors! Both add such depth and interesting perspectives to our beloved characters. Both deserve the title of Best New Author, really. I wonder if a tie will become a tradition for this category...
[02:41] <LynnSM> It is indeed an honour to pass the baton along to...
[02:41] <mozartmaid> ...drum roll please...
[02:41] <LynnSM> Anti-Kryptonite. Congratulations!!! :)
[02:41] * amberlea sets mode: +v AntiKryptoni
[02:41] <mozartmaid> Congratulations Anti-Kryptonite!!
[02:42] <Classicalla> Congratulations Anti-K!!
[02:43] <AntiKryptoni> Thank you! Watching this inspiring show and reading the hundreds--even thousands--of stories that come from that inspiration, I think we can all agree that Superman is the superhero we all know and love so well in part because he is supported and encouraged and helped by Lois Lane. Well--even though it‚Äôs a bit audacious to make this comparison for myself--I just want to say that if Best 
[02:43] <AntiKryptoni> New Author is Superman, then my family members who support me in everything (even the obsessive love of this show), my beta-readers who give me all the right advice, and all the wonderful people who leave feedback--which is definitely as rejuvenating to a writer as sunlight is to Superman--on each of my stories--well, you‚Äôre all my Lois Lane. So thank you for everything you do and for 
[02:43] <AntiKryptoni> making my life that much brighter. I love you. :)

[02:50] <amberlea> Before we get to the last presentation, I'd like to take a moment to recognize all of the hard-working FoLCs behind the scenes that make this ceremony possible.
[02:50] <amberlea> So, thanks to the K-Comm, for everything they do!
[02:52] <amberlea> And if there's anyone else I should be thanking, please consider yourself appropriately appreciated!  :)
[02:53] <amberlea> For the Best Overall category, a haiku.
[02:53] <amberlea> Best overall fic
[02:53] <amberlea> Is no small feat to achieve
[02:53] <amberlea> What adulation
[02:54] <amberlea> In further honor of the Best Overall category, a limerick.
[02:54] <amberlea> There once was a reporter named Clark
[02:55] <amberlea> Whose love for Lois could light up the dark
[02:55] <amberlea> So many stories could be written
[02:56] <amberlea> By those whom plot bunnies have bitten
[02:56] <amberlea> But to be Best Overall is quite a high mark
[02:57] <amberlea> And now, an ode to the Best Overall category.
[02:57] <amberlea> Never mind, I ran out of time to write an ode.
[02:57] <amberlea> Maybe next year!
[02:58] <amberlea> And the nominees are:
[02:59] <amberlea> And Then There Was Light by Anti-Kryptonite
[02:59] <amberlea> Blind (Super) Man's Bluff by ML Thompson
[02:59] <amberlea> The Other Shoe by Sue S
[02:59] <amberlea> The Wonder of Love by Terry Leatherwood
[03:00] <amberlea> and Trusting Me, Trusting You by Female Hawk
[03:00] <amberlea> And the winner of the 2012 Kerth Award for Best Overall Story is...
[03:01] <amberlea> Trusting Me, Trusting You by Female Hawk!
[03:01] * amberlea sets mode: +v Corrina
[03:01] <Corrina> Wow!
[03:01] <Corrina> Thanks everyone.
[03:01] * amberlea sets mode: -v AntiKryptoni
[03:02] <Corrina> Firstly, I'd like to congratulate the authors of the other four stories - I think they showcase the diversity and excellence we enjoy in FOLCdom
[03:03] <Corrina> Secondly, as already mentioned by Amber - thanks to the K-Comm for their tireless work in organising these awards.
[03:04] <Corrina> Thirdly, to those people who BR or GE or give FDK - their contribution to the fandom is invaluable
[03:05] <Corrina> And, as a writer, many thanks to the readers.  Without you, I can write stories, but it's rather pointless if I can't share them.
[03:05] <Corrina> Lastly, a more personal thanks ...
[03:07] <Corrina> To my hubby of 27 years, who a few month ago decided to open up a Female Hawk story.  Since then, he's moved his way through most of my stories.  Thanks to him for his generous support, encouragement, and being my perfect partner in so many things.  ILU, Greg!
[03:09] <amberlea> Congratulations to Corrina and all of the other winners!
[03:09] <amberlea> Thanks to everyone for coming out to the ceremony!

[22:01] <amberlea> Welcome everyone!
[22:02] <amberlea> It's so great to see everyone who made it out for this year's ceremony!
[22:02] <amberlea> Before we get started, I'd like to thank everyone who volunteered to present this year.
[22:03] <amberlea> This ceremony wouldn't be possible without them.
[22:04] <amberlea> I'm so happy to get to coordinate the ceremony again this year.  We have the best fans of any show!
[22:05] <amberlea> So let's get started!
[22:05] <amberlea> I'd like to welcome our first presenter of the show...Virginia!
[22:06] * amberlea sets mode: +v VirginiaR
[22:06] <amberlea> Virginia is presenting the award for Best Super Short Story.
[22:07] * VirginiaR walks on stage in a full-length maroon velvet gown with cap sleeves. It has been cleaned from all tomato stains from last year‚Äôs awards and her bad jokes. She has tied her Mayson length blonde hair back into a French Twist.
[22:08] * VirginiaR At center stage, she pauses and glances around for the microphone. None is present.
[22:08] * VirginiaR starts to return towards stage right, only to have the microphone finally emerge from the floor stage center.
[22:08] <amberlea> sorry!
[22:09] * VirginiaR returns center stage to find that the microphone only comes up to my knees.
[22:09] * VirginiaR mumbling
[22:09] <VirginiaR> You‚Äôve got to be kidding me.
[22:10] * VirginiaR The microphone stand extends to full length.
[22:10] <VirginiaR> That wasn‚Äôt what I expected when I volunteered to present the 'Super Short' category.  Perhaps *I‚Äôm* not what they expected.
[22:10] * VirginiaR pauses for groans for her bad joke
[22:11] <VirginiaR> This year we have five authors and six stories nominated in the 'Super Short Story' category.  
[22:11] <VirginiaR> The great thing about all of these stories is that though they can easily be read in between back-to-back meetings, when you really shouldn‚Äôt be sneaking away to read FanFiction, but we know so many people do, they are written so well that they continue to have us pondering and sometimes chuckling about them hours, days, months, and now a year later.
[22:12] <VirginiaR> In order of fairness, it should be mentioned that I did Beta RodStewFan‚Äôs two stories.  So, it‚Äôs almost as if you nominated me twice, as well.  
[22:12] * VirginiaR high fives self -- twice
[22:13] <VirginiaR> Okay, not really.  But I‚Äôm okay with that, really.  I mean, it‚Äôs not as if anyone expected any of *my* stories to qualify for this category anyway.
[22:13] * amberlea changes topic to 'Best Super Short Winner: One Small Detail by M'
[22:13] <amberlea> oh my goodness!
[22:13] <amberlea> I'm sorry!
[22:13] * VirginiaR ignores amber and pauses for groans from this overdone joke
[22:14] <VirginiaR> Moving on.  
[22:14] * amberlea changes topic to 'Pay no attention to the woman behind the curtain. :)'
[22:14] <VirginiaR> In 'Cold Feet' Lois rushes to Clark‚Äôs apartment on the eve of her wedding, having come upon an unexpected realization, and in 'SOLD! To the Highest Bidder' Clark makes the mistake of not reading the fine print before accepting a charity gig for Superman.  
[22:14] <VirginiaR> Both of these stories are highly entertaining for very different reasons, mainly because RodStewFan‚Äôs ability to fine tune a twist.
[22:15] * VirginiaR Demonstrates the twist dance.
[22:15] <VirginiaR> Female Hawk allows us to follow Perry back to his earliest years in the news business to when he learned the importance of 'One Small Detail.'
[22:16] <VirginiaR> Morgana shows us how a former Nigerian princess taught a young man with 'A Lovely Smile' how to ballroom dance.
[22:16] <VirginiaR> Bakasi informs us about the dangers of dimension hopping in her side-splittingly funny story 'Lunkheads'.
[22:16] <VirginiaR> Finally, Mouserocks has Lois determined to get her partner and get him good in another April Comedy Challenge contender... 'Aftershocks'. 
[22:17] <VirginiaR> Now, that I‚Äôve rambled on longer than most of Lynn S.M.‚Äôs stories 
[22:17] * VirginiaR ducks behind microphone
[22:17] <VirginiaR> ... combined...
[22:17] * VirginiaR ducks again
[22:18] <VirginiaR> Let‚Äôs see who‚Äôs name they‚Äôve put in my envelope...
[22:18] * VirginiaR With a flourish, I produce a green glowing dagger from my bodice to cut open the envelope
[22:19] <VirginiaR> Oh, dear.  It looks as if Clark has passed out.  Will someone please stuff him back into Sue‚Äôs velour-lined lead closet, please?  
[22:20] <VirginiaR> And the winner is...
[22:20] <VirginiaR> One Small Detail by Female Hawk
[22:21] * amberlea sets mode: +v Corrina
[22:21] * VirginiaR steps back and applauds Corrina
[22:21] * amberlea changes topic to 'Best Super Short winner: One Small Detail by Female Hawk!'
[22:21] <Corrina> Wow.  Thanks.
[22:22] <Corrina> It's early morning here, so forgive me for not checking who betaed this story.  Thanks to Iolanthe because she's betaed everything I've ever written.
[22:22] <Corrina> And maybe Lynn, too.
[22:23] <Corrina> Also thanks to Labrat, because I do remember that I wrote this story in response to her call for more stories for the archive.
[22:23] <Corrina> Many thanks to those who read this ficlet.  I'm stoked you enjoyed it!
[22:25] <amberlea> Congratulations Corrina!

[22:26] <amberlea> Our next presenter is KenJ.  Welcome to the stage!
[22:26] * amberlea sets mode: +v KenJ
[22:27] <KenJ> Ken steps on stage and trips over his own feet.  Grabs microphone stand to keep from falling.
[22:27] <KenJ> I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm not as creative as Virginia, though I may be almost as long winded, not really.  Who could be?
[22:27] <KenJ> Looking sheepish, he says, ‚ÄúSorry about that.‚Äù 
[22:27] <KenJ> All right, the next category is Best Short Story.
[22:28] <KenJ> This year there were 8 stories nominated.
[22:28] <KenJ> To take a page from Virginia‚Äôs book, I have to say that in the inrerest of fulldisclosure, I was involved in 3 of them as a beta reader.
[22:28] <KenJ> The stories, in alphabetical order are:
[22:28] <KenJ> A Day at the Beach by NostalgiaKick, a tale where Lois and Clark unexpectedly have the day off and decide to go swimming together.
[22:29] <KenJ> Encounter in the Woods by Mary Potts ‚Äì Young Clark accidentally meets and adult Lois and Clark when they are on a trip with Herb Wells
[22:29] <KenJ> Fire Drill by Sue S ‚Äì A delightful tale about a fire drill conducted by the DP which throws Lois and Clark together when the move away from the smokers.
[22:29] <KenJ> Lois and Castle by Tank Wilson ‚Äì An intriguing crossover tale between Lois and Clark and Castle.
[22:29] <KenJ> Miracle by Deadly Chakram ‚Äì What better miracle than to have a child and see your husband bond with the child and become a father.
[22:30] <KenJ> Practically Married by KatherineKent, where Lois has to move in with Clark, temporarily, and winds up staying
[22:30] <KenJ> The Ears Have it by Sue S ‚Äì Lois has to deal with a blind Superman and Clark has to deal with his feelings for Lois.
[22:30] <KenJ> And 
[22:30] <KenJ> Waiting in Line by KatherineKent, about young Lois and Clark waiting to have a chance to visit with Santa
[22:30] <KenJ> That was a long list and some hard choices.
[22:31] <KenJ> Okay, there they are.  Personally, I enjoyed every word of every story and I assure you, I read every one.
[22:31] <KenJ> Personally I had a hard time deciding which one to vote for.
[22:31] <KenJ> Envelope, please.
[22:32] <KenJ> How do I get the envelope?
[22:34] <KenJ> Maybe I just went too fast.
[22:34] <KenJ> Starts doing  shoe routine.soft
[22:35] <KenJ> I cheated - cut and paste
[22:35] <KenJ> And then there's the one
[22:36] <KenJ> I\Obviously I've never done this before.

[22:39] <KenJ> I can't find the IM window. Send me an e-mail Amber

[22:40] <KenJ> Okay folks
[22:40] <KenJ> I got the email
[22:40] <KenJ> And the winner is - 
[22:40] <KenJ> Uh Oh.
[22:40] <KenJ> It looks like we have a tie!
[22:41] <KenJ> The two winners are - in alphabetical order
[22:41] <KenJ> Practically Married by KatherineKent, where Lois has to move in with Clark, temporarily, and winds up staying
[22:41] <KenJ> and 
[22:41] <KenJ> The Ears Have it by Sue S ‚Äì Lois has to deal with a blind Superman and Clark has to deal with his feelings for Lois.

[22:42] <KKent> Oh my goodness.  I don't know what to say

[22:42] <KKent> Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone that voted.
[22:43] <KKent> Thank you to Ken for being my Beta on this
[22:43] <KKent> Just in case no-one realises - this was my FIRST ever LnC fic.

[22:46] <amberlea> Please welcome Michael to the stage!
[22:46] <DarthMichael> Mid-Length storiesÖ
[22:46] * DarthMichael breathes deeply while fumbling with James Earl Jones vocoder
[22:46] * DarthMichael now has deeper voice
[22:46] <DarthMichael> Well, I guess they deserve a mid-length introduction, too, 
[22:46] <DarthMichael> only after that awesome Super Short introduction, mine will be actually shorter...
[22:47] <DarthMichael> Anyway, and in a attempt to use some more words, 
[22:47] <DarthMichael> I'd like to thank the Fates -- no, I donít mean you, Tempus --
[22:47] <DarthMichael> that made this early start of the Kerths possible. That way, I get to present :)
[22:47] <DarthMichael> Umm... where was I?
[22:47] <DarthMichael> Oh, right, mid-length stories, or what some Evil Readers like to call Virginia Shorts,
[22:47] <DarthMichael> they're just right for a relaxed evening, complete with staying up just a bit late,
[22:48] <DarthMichael> given how they are between 51-200kB long.
[22:48] <DarthMichael> Just beware, because anything can happen in them, 
[22:48] * DarthMichael adjusts leadlined glasses
[22:48] <DarthMichael> from braving Lois's cooking to getting grilled by her in the spotlight.

[22:56] <amberlea> As anyone who has ever written a term paper knows, being verbose is a valuable skill.
[22:56] <amberlea> As every teacher knows, however, being verbose does not equal quality writing!
[22:57] <amberlea> Our nominated authors for Best Long Story may or may not have honed their skills as students striving for a requisite paper length,
[22:57] <amberlea> but either way we are all the better for their abilities!

[23:03] <amberlea> Disclaimer:
[23:04] <amberlea> The statistics you are about to see in this segment are wholly fictional and made up out of whole cloth.
[23:04] <amberlea> Did you know that of the 3809 stories on the Lois & Clark Fanfic Archive,
[23:04] <amberlea> a full 75% of them are Revelation stories?
[23:05] <amberlea> Of those, 95% tackle the issue of Lois Lane learning that Clark Kent is Superman.
[23:06] <amberlea> Among those 95%, Lois is angry over being deceived 100% of the time.
[23:06] <amberlea> Of the authors nominated for Best Revelation,
[23:06] <amberlea> 100% of the stories are worth reading.
[23:07] <amberlea> And that statistic is the truth!  :)

[23:14] <amberlea> Our next presenter is... still me!  :)
[23:14] <amberlea> Among all other writers, fanfic authors have a unique responsibility and opportunity.
[23:14] <amberlea> They have established characters which they must portray accurately, as judged by each reader.
[23:14] <amberlea> Then the author's original characters must also have unique personalities and interact believably with the established characters.
[23:15] <amberlea> No small feat, indeed.
[23:15] <amberlea> This year's nominees for Best Original or Supporting Character have managed to accomplish both objectives in superior fashion.
[23:16] <amberlea> The nominees are:
[23:16] <amberlea> From Birthday Surprise by Thomas Mc: Kristen & Paul 
[23:17] <amberlea> From Jerome's Wedding by Lynn S.M.: Todd
[23:17] <amberlea> From Strangers in Our Midst by Morgana: Aykira
[23:18] <amberlea> From Vampire Murders by Nan Smith: Night Eagle
[23:18] <amberlea> And from When Death Comes Knocking, Punch Him In The Mouth by Terry Leatherwood: Jennifer Marlow & Alan Robertson
[23:18] <amberlea> And the winner is...
[23:18] [amberlea SOUND]
[23:19] <amberlea> Night Eagle from Vampire Murders by Nan Smith!
[23:19] * amberlea sets mode: +v Nan
[23:19] <amberlea> Congratulations Nan!
[23:19] <Nan> Wow!
[23:20] <Nan> I didn't really prepare a speech because I really didn't think I had much of a chance.
[23:21] <Nan> The Vampire Murders took two years to write and i was afraid no one was interested anymore.
[23:21] * amberlea changes topic to 'Best O/S Character: Nan Smith!'
[23:21] <Nan> Thank you so much. I feel really honored that people liked my story, and my "vampire".

[23:31] <KKent> But I think most of all, I'd like to thank Corrina.  Her stories inspired to me renew my love of LnC
[23:32] <KKent> I promised you I'd get on the LnC boards one day Corrina ... and look at me now.
[23:32] * KKent Takes a dramatic bow and then walks unsteadily back to her seat

[23:34] <amberlea> Okay, now I need everyone to pretend that I'm Morgana, just for a few minutes.
[23:35] <amberlea> As the words from one very old and romantic song said:
[23:35] <amberlea> ‚ÄòA kiss is just a kiss and a sigh is just a sigh ...‚Äô
[23:36] <amberlea> That‚Äôs something we FoLC‚Äôs appreciate is a great kiss!
[23:36] <amberlea> It can be long and smoldering or short and sweet, 
[23:36] <amberlea> but we love ‚Äòem!

[23:46] <amberlea> The Best Overall Story Award requires no explanation.

[23:48] <amberlea> So give yourselves a hand, FoLCs!
[23:48] <amberlea> And remember, if you want to keep being the best, you have to leave FDK for the authors.

[23:54] * amberlea sets mode: +v Corrina
[23:54] <amberlea> Congratulations Corrina!
[23:54] * amberlea changes topic to 'Best Overall: Female Hawk!'
[23:54] <Corrina> You know, looking at that list of stories, this fandom is in great shape.
[23:55] <Corrina> I'm honoured that my story was selected.  All of the nominated stories would have been worthy winners.
[23:56] <Corrina> I had the privilege of betaing 3 of them.
[23:56] <Corrina> So ... thank you ... a huge thanks to this community.  It's such a great place to hang out - so supportive, a lot of fun, very encouraging.
[23:57] <Corrina> I have made some great friends on these boards.
[23:57] <Corrina> I hadn't planned to say this now, but my current fic will probably be my last one for a while.
[23:58] <Corrina> A few months ago, my life moved into a new season.  My husband was made redundant.  The next day, we were offered an amazing opportunity that is going to take up most of my time for at least 18 months.
Session Time: Sun Apr 13 00:00:00 2014
[00:00] <Corrina> Unfortunately, that means there won't be much time to write LnC.  I still hope to be around the boards, and maybe I'll be able to write something short, but long stories just aren't going to happen.
[00:00] <Corrina> So ... this isn't '
[00:00] <Corrina> 'good-bye', just 'see you around'
[00:00] <Corrina> And I'll definitely be finishing 'The Wedding'.
[00:01] <Corrina> To all those still writing LnC - and those who are thinking about writing LnC - keep the fires burning.  I can vouch for the fact that LnC readers are the best in the world.
[00:02] <Corrina> So, thanks to my BRs, my friends, my readers, and I suppose to the creators of LnC:TNAOS, who started this amazing version of an old story.
[00:02] <Corrina> God bless!
[00:02] <amberlea> Thank you, Corrina!
[00:03] <amberlea> Best of luck on your new opportunity, and you know where to find us!  :)
[00:03] <amberlea> That wraps up the 2014 Kerth Awards Ceremony!  
[00:04] <amberlea> I can't say thank you enough to the people who stepped up to present!
