[00:02] <VickiM> ooh, even Darthy is here!
[00:02] <KarenT> woo!
[00:02] <mozartmaid> I see that there is a sound on the kerthawards window, but I didn't hear anything... is there someway to set up for sound through mIRC that I missed?
[00:03] <VickiM> let me see if it works here, mozart
[00:03] <mozartmaid> waves at Corrina!
[00:03] <VickiM> hmm...saying it doesn't exist?
[00:03] <mozartmaid> thanks Vicki
[00:03] <VickiM> weirdness
[00:04] <KarenT> are the sounds in the right folder?
[00:04] <mozartmaid> interesting... oh, and hi Iolanthe :)
[00:04] <VickiM> yeah with all my irc sounds
[00:04] <KarenT> odd
[00:04] <ChiefPam> Is it sad that I can sing along with the heyba song?
[00:04] <KarenT> lol
[00:04] <VickiM> lol
[00:04] <hachiban> I haven't got any sounds.
[00:04] <Meadowlark> And I haven't heard anything yet
[00:05] <VickiM> maybe something with the chat settings?  it works straight through my computer, but not through irc for some reason
[00:05] <Meadowlark> let me try it here...
[00:05] <Dernit> under options sounds, you have to make sure enable sounds is checked I think
[00:05] [Meadowlark SOUND]
[00:05] <VickiM> still can't hear it
[00:05] <IolantheAlia> That worked for me - I hear the heyba now!
[00:05] <Meadowlark> I hear my own  <g>

[00:06] * KarenT boogies

[00:08] <VickiM> hmm...just switched some stuff around...wasn't connecting with the right folder
[00:08] <Dernit> hearing
[00:08] [VickiM SOUND]
[00:08] <VickiM> there we go!
[00:08] <VickiM> makes waaaaay more sense now
[00:08] <IolantheAlia> Are you playing the heyba again, or is every sound that I hear going to be the heyba?  
[00:08] <mozartmaid> how did you do it?
[00:08] <VickiM> I guess I didn't fix it when I got the new laptop
[00:08] <VickiM> go to Tools - Options
[00:08] [Dernit SOUND]
[00:09] <VickiM> then sounds
[00:09] <VickiM> and switch the folder where the sounds go/are to where you have them
[00:09] <VickiM> it's sounds - requests
[00:09] <Classicalla> Hello, all.  
[00:11] <VickiM> Hiya!
[00:11] * VickiM waves
[00:11] <ChiefPam> I'm using a new chat program on my linux laptop.  I think I have it set up with the directory where my sounds are.
[00:12] <KarenT> cool. what program?
[00:12] <ChiefPam> XChat
[00:12] <KarenT> aaaahhh
[00:12] <ChiefPam> still not hearing any sounds, tho
[00:12] <VickiM> weird
[00:13] <hachiban> I went to my mIRC folder and there aren't any sounds there. What do I do?
[00:14] <VickiM> is there a techie in the house?
[00:14] <ChiefPam> search your computer for .wav files?
[00:14] <LaurenW> Thanks, Karen! Have changed home page.
[00:14] <mozartmaid> is there a file link somewhere on the boards with the file sounds? I think I remember reading it somewhere?? Anyone have the link? 
[00:14] <AntiKryptoni> Looks like they're starting!
[00:14] * amberlea is now known as for_AnnaBtG
[00:14] <Mouserocks> Woo-hoo!!
[00:14] <LaurenW> Everybody have fun tonight. Wish I could stay -- got to go to work. Bummer.
[00:14] <Classicalla> I've never ever been able to get the sounds to work....

[00:16] <LynnSM> Hi all!
[00:16] <IolantheAlia> I love for_anna's introduction!
[00:16] <LynnSM> It's great to be here. I didn't think I'd make it.
[00:16] <Mouserocks> (^have to do something to stay original)
[00:16] <AntiKryptoni> Wow, this is a great presentation.
[00:16] <Classicalla> Ah, there you are, Lynn.  I'm glad you figured out the problem of getting on.
[00:17] <VickiM>  Love this already <big grin>
[00:17] <AntiKryptoni> Congratulations, Lynn, on the nomination!
[00:17] <LynnSM> Thanks, Anti-K
[00:17] <lncroxmysox> *claps for nominees*
[00:17] <LynnSM> And it looks like I made it just in time.
[00:17] <KarenT> yep!
[00:18] <IolantheAlia> There were some really tough votes - frankly, I thought all of the stories were Kerth-worthy!  It was very hard to make the decision.
[00:18] * VickiM is on the edge of her seat
[00:18] <Mouserocks> Woo-hoo! Congrats to all nominees!
[00:18] <LynnSM> I felt that way for a lot of the categories.
[00:18] <Mouserocks> Very tough decisions, that's for sure. 
[00:19] * VickiM cheers for the nominees
[00:19] <LynnSM> Congratulations. Shayne!
[00:19] <lncroxmysox> *applause*
[00:19] <AntiKryptoni> Congratulations!
[00:19] <VickiM> Congrats Shayne!
[00:19] <LynnSM> It was well-earned.
[00:19] <LynnSM> :)
[00:19] <Mouserocks> Yay! Congrats, Shayne!
[00:19] * for_AnnaBtG is now known as amberlea
[00:19] <Corrina> congratulations, Shayne.  That was a great story
[00:19] <AlishaK2> well done shayne
[00:19] <Classicalla> Congrats!
[00:19] <IolantheAlia> Good for you, Shayne1
[00:19] <KarenT> Congrats, Shayne!
[00:20] * VickiM heartily applauds
[00:20] <mozartmaid> getting distracted by trying to connect sounds ... congrats Shayne!! :)
[00:20] <hachiban> Congratulations, Shayne.
[00:20] <VickiM> lol I couldn't hear those either Mozart
[00:20] * Evelite has joined #kerthchat
[00:20] <IolantheAlia> I couldn't hear those sounds either!  Funny, because the heyba worked before.
[00:20] <Classicalla> Hello, Evelite
[00:20] <IolantheAlia> And hi Evelite
[00:20] * ChiefPam has quit IRC (Signed off)
[00:21] * VickiM shrugs and gives up with the techie stuff
[00:21] <hachiban> Still struggling to fix my sounds. This Windows 7 OS makes it virtually impossible to find what you need. They don't want you fiddling with it, so they hide everything.
[00:21] <KarenT> hi, Evelite!
[00:21] <LynnSM> I downloaded the sounds to the relevant place, but I'm not hearing them, either.
[00:21] <LynnSM> All I'm hearing are the regular "person joined the chatroom" type sounds.
[00:21] <VickiM> I have those disabled but I should be hearing the wavs....
[00:21] <LynnSM> Can one hear the one without the other?
[00:21] * ChiefPam has joined #kerthchat
[00:22] <Mouserocks> I've still got no sounds, but my day's been stressful enough without trying to wrangle 'up some sounds 
[00:22] <LynnSM> I'm getting close to just turning them all off, like I did last year.
[00:22] <VickiM> awww
[00:22] <LynnSM> I'm just glad to have gotten on.
[00:22] <Mouserocks> So no sounds for me :(
[00:22] <AntiKryptoni> Me, too! I didn't even bother trying to figure out sounds on top of learning everything else!
[00:22] <ChiefPam> stupid program.  Why can't I have two windows open at once?
[00:23] <Evelite> Hello! 
[00:23] <LynnSM> Hi Evelite.
[00:23] <VickiM> Hi Evelite
[00:24] <Classicalla> Anyone want some homemade guacamole?  =}
[00:24] <LynnSM> Congrats on the nominatino, Alisha.
[00:24] <AlishaK2> Thanks Lynn
[00:24] <Mouserocks> No guac for me. Doesn't go with my banana cream pie. 
[00:24] <AlishaK2> And ditto!
[00:24] <KarenT> ooh, that'd be awesome! mmmm, guac
[00:24] <LynnSM> Let me just reiterate how much I love the story you wrote for me. :)
[00:24] <KarenT> though I need to go get a bowl of sketti
[00:24] <AlishaK2> Aw, I'm blushing now.
[00:25] * VickiM claps for all of the nominees
[00:25] <LynnSM> And congrats to you, too, MozartMaid and Mouserocks
[00:25] <Classicalla> Banana creme pie sounds better!
[00:25] <VickiM> Congrats on the noms, guys :)
[00:25] <mozartmaid> thanks :)
[00:25] <Mouserocks> Congrats to all nominees!
[00:25] <IolantheAlia> Holy cow, a tie?!
[00:25] * VickiM offers up a bowl of chocolate
[00:25] <LynnSM> Ooh... A tie!
[00:25] <KarenT> is it a loud tie?
[00:25] <LynnSM> LOL
[00:25] <mozartmaid> lol
[00:25] <Mouserocks> lol!
[00:25] <VickiM> a tie! o..O
[00:25] <LynnSM> Yay, Alisha!

[00:27] <lncroxmysox> Speech!Speech!
[00:27] <LynnSM> Is it just me, or did others find the next category especially hard to choose from?
[00:27] <LynnSM> There were just so many outstanding stories in it.
[00:28] <VickiM>  They were ALL hard to choose Lynn. :)
[00:28] <IolantheAlia> Alisha I love your stories!
[00:28] <Classicalla> It's always hard choosing!
[00:28] <Mouserocks> Agreed! No easy categories for me!
[00:29] * ChiefPam has quit IRC (Signed off)
[00:29] <LynnSM> I won't argue there.
[00:29] <mozartmaid> I know the feeling Alisha *looks around, feeling a bit guilty about not being on the boards so much lately...
[00:29] <lncroxmysox> *applause*
[00:29] <LynnSM> You're most welcome, Alisha. I feel like a winner in this category myself, since you wrote the story for me. :)
[00:29] * VickiM wildly applauds
[00:30] <lncroxmysox> Yay Alisha! Yay Bob!
[00:30] <Dernit> I've been gone for years, with unfinished stories, so I have an idea how that feels ;)

[00:41] <IolantheAlia> Nan, you write great stories.  I can't tell you how often I've re-read your stuff on the Archive.
[00:41] <ChiefPam> little or not
[00:42] <LynnSM> It's quality, not quantity, that matters. And your story did have quality
[00:42] <mozartmaid> too true
[00:42] <hachiban> Karen, my stupid anti virus kicked in and interfered with your send. Can you try it again?
[00:42] <AntiKryptoni> Nicely put, Lynn!
[00:42] <VickiM> very true Lynn

[00:43] * amberlea is now known as for_Virginia
[00:43] * VickiM cheers for Lynn
[00:43] <Meadowlark> I agree its not the length that matters.  Nan's story should also have been nominated as a Comedy.
[00:43] <VickiM> gah
[00:43] <VickiM> meant Nan
[00:43] <VickiM> but I will cheer for Lynn too
[00:44] <ChiefPam> coming or going, heh
[00:44] <VickiM> lol
[00:44] <LynnSM> <chuckle> I had been wondering why you were cheering; I had figured you were just agreeing with my "quality, not quantity" sentiment.
[00:44] <VickiM> yeah well, that too
[00:44] <VickiM> I blame Chris - she has typoitis, and it is HIGHLY contagious :)
[00:45] <Chrispat> lol
[00:45] <mozartmaid> lol
[00:45] <AntiKryptoni> Nice tie-in to ScifiJoan's story!
[00:45] <VickiM> lol @ commerical
[00:45] * for_Virginia is now known as amberlea
[00:45] <mozartmaid> cute
[00:46] <mozartmaid> middle of the night, here! ;)
[00:47] <Corrina> breakfast time, here!
[00:47] <VickiM> Evening here :)
[00:47] <AlishaK2> yup, middle of the night it is
[00:47] <ChiefPam> dinner time here, but Kelley is cooking for me :)
[00:47] <mozartmaid> Is it Sunday morn' Corrina?
[00:47] <AntiKryptoni> Late in the afternoon where I am.
[00:47] <ChiefPam> go, Corrina!
[00:48] <mozartmaid> Corrina is in " the future" ;)
[00:48] <ChiefPam> lol
[00:48] <ChiefPam> Woman of tomorrow ;)
[00:48] <KarenT> dinner time here... spaghetti night
[00:48] <VickiM> is she hanging out with Tempus *again*?!?!
[00:48] <mozartmaid> lol
[00:49] <Classicalla> Almost 7 pm here.
[00:49] <VickiM> same here Classicalla
[00:49] <LynnSM> Ditto.
[00:49] <VickiM> horray for the eastern seaboard :)
[00:49] <mozartmaid> now that's the sweet spot. 7PM is perfect prime time award ceremony time :)
[00:49] <Chrispat> No west coasters?
[00:50] <LynnSM> It is nice. 8:00 would have been better for me, though, since DS would have been in bed.
[00:50] <AntiKryptoni> Ahhh. That's sweet.
[00:50] <mozartmaid> I'm in Germany. Almost 1AM . Will have to work hard to make it to present :P
[00:50] <hachiban> Hi Chris!
[00:50] <Chrispat> Hi Nan :)
[00:50] * Mouserocks has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[00:50] <LynnSM> As it is, he gets to watch a rare TV marathon (He's on his second Blue's Clues videotape -- yes videotape! -- for the evening.)
[00:50] <mozartmaid> yay for waffy! :D
[00:50] <VickiM> awwww
[00:50] <Chrispat> lol
[00:50] <lncroxmysox> <--west coast:)
[00:50] <KarenT> considering the crying I hear in the other room, middle of the night might be better for me!
[00:50] <KarenT> or maybe for my husband :/
[00:51] <lncroxmysox> after the ceremony i'm going to do some gardening:)
[00:51] <AlishaK2> I'm an hour behind you in the UK, mozartmaid
[00:51] <mozartmaid> aww
[00:51] <Chrispat> lol
[00:51] <VickiM> awwww
[00:51] <LynnSM> I'm starting to melt into a puddle of WAFF just remembering the stories in this category.
[00:51] <mozartmaid> well, that's some company anyway @Alisha
[00:51] <VickiM> my too Lynn
[00:51] <Chrispat> Didn't we used to do the Kerths at 3PM ET?
[00:52] <KarenT> I think once or twice we did. But all the transcripts I found was 6pm ET
[00:52] <VickiM> Anti-K nailed the senses :)
[00:52] <ChiefPam> love the raisin story
[00:52] <IolantheAlia> AK's "senses" series was great!  I think they all deserved nominations.
[00:52] <mozartmaid> true

[01:15] <ChiefPam> Lynn, my brain just inserted the "s" for you, so no worries
[01:16] <LynnSM> Thanks.
[01:16] <LynnSM> Did it also insert an "i" in "spoil"?
[01:16] <LynnSM> I seem to have caught the typo bug.

[01:16] <mozartmaid> mine too:)
[01:16] <VickiM> I told you!  Blame Chris
[01:16] * AMCiotola has joined #kerthchat

[01:19] <IolantheAlia> The "Just Say My Name" were tough to write because the character could only say the other person's name and nothing else1
[01:19] <KarenT> no, Tricia doesn't have IRC anymore
[01:19] * CarolM waves -time got away from her

[01:23] <VickiM> Nicely put, AntiK :)
[01:23] <AntiKryptoni> Thanks!
[01:24] <LynnSM> What a wonderful acceptance speech.
[01:24] * for_Michael is now known as amberlea
[01:24] <LynnSM> Are there alt-Kerths for acceptance speeches? Is fo, Anti-K should win it.
[01:24] * AntiKryptoni blushes
[01:24] <CarolM> I think there was one year lynn
[01:24] * amberlea is now known as for_Virginia
[01:24] <LynnSM> "Is fo"? "Is fo"? "If so," is what I meant/
[01:25] <AntiKryptoni> You're the one who told me to prepare 'just in case' speeches--I took you at your word. :)
[01:25] <Mouserocks> Great speech, Anti-K!!
[01:25] <LynnSM> Really, Carol? I had been joking about the category (but not about the speech.)
[01:25] <LynnSM> I knew you'd win at least one award.
[01:25] <LynnSM> I imagine you'll win more before the night is out.
[01:26] <VickiM> lol@ commerical
[01:26] <CarolM> it may have just been 'line from the kerths' [winner was melisma with you get the jpg iirc] but that was... 02? not sure...
[01:26] <IolantheAlia> Olef's Color Brite Detergent?  Wasn't that mentioned in Nan's story about Superman's laundry?
[01:26] <IolantheAlia> Hee hee hee
[01:26] <KarenT> hee
[01:26] <VickiM> LOL!  Clark did 
[01:26] <AlishaK2> there hasn't been an alt kerth since i joined the boards, & I've been here a while now...
[01:26] <LynnSM> <chuckle>
[01:26] <Mouserocks> hehehehe...
[01:26] <ChiefPam> lol
[01:26] <VickiM> what's an alt-Kerth....?
[01:26] <mozartmaid> lol
[01:27] <ChiefPam> It's like the Kerths, only with sillier categories <g>
[01:27] * for_Virginia is now known as amberlea
[01:27] <VickiM> ah
[01:27] <VickiM> gotcha
[01:27] <VickiM> thanks
[01:27] <CarolM> alt-kerth = non story stuff [like speeches ;) or vids best fdk title thread]
[01:27] <VickiM> awesome :)
[01:27] <ChiefPam> and not just fanfic
[01:27] <hachiban> To think, I'm now known for Olef's Color Brite Detergent .... 
[01:27] <AntiKryptoni> LOL!
[01:27] <ChiefPam> lol, Nan, own it!
[01:27] <CarolM> go nan!
[01:28] <LynnSM> I've never attended one (I'm a relative newbie tot he fandom), but I've heard that they had categories for best videos, for example.
[01:28] <ChiefPam> I'm going to go out on a limb and bet that there will, in fact, be more ties :)
[01:28] <Chrispat> Best web sites, etc
[01:29] <LynnSM> There are only two nominees in the BNA category. Wouldn't it be fun if they both won?
[01:29] <VickiM> AntiK will win that one - I'd bet my last dollar
[01:29] * amberlea is now known as for_Michael
[01:29] <AntiKryptoni> What about What Is Eternal? That's a great story!
[01:29] <ChiefPam> Ooh, another Michael speech...
[01:29] * KarenT whistles and hides the envelopes
[01:29] * lwf has joined #kerthchat
[01:29] <VickiM> Aww, thanks, AntiK
[01:29] * VickiM blushes
[01:30] <Mouserocks> heehee, and i thought he was just peeking at all the envelopes
[01:30] <VickiM> lol, Mouse
[01:30] <AntiKryptoni> LOL!
[01:31] <ChiefPam> lol. I'm going with option #2!
[01:31] <Corrina> that's true
[01:31] <KarenT> lol
[01:31] <AntiKryptoni> Nah!
[01:31] <LynnSM> Was he steaming them open?
[01:31] <mozartmaid> yeah, usually option 2 ;)
[01:31] <LynnSM> Or did he just ask Clark to do a little super-peeking?
[01:31] <VickiM> LOL!
[01:32] <IolantheAlia> We all know Clark would never peek without permission.
[01:32] <VickiM> that was hilarious, Lois' stolen garbage
[01:32] <ChiefPam> to be fair, an episode can only explore so much about the premise, so we need to rewrite to see how things could have been different if...
[01:32] <Mouserocks> Thats where the jedi mind tricks come in
[01:32] <Mouserocks> "peek into the envelopes, Clark..."
[01:32] <AntiKryptoni> LOL!
[01:32] <VickiM> so...Clark is weak-minded? ;)
[01:32] <LynnSM> Or red kryptonite. Or hypnosis. Or magic. Or...
[01:32] <mozartmaid> exactly. @Pam
[01:32] <VickiM> Anti-K's was great 
[01:33] <AntiKryptoni> Thanks!
[01:33] <IolantheAlia> Congrats AK on two nominees!
[01:33] <mozartmaid> Father's Kryptonite -- so well-written and Jonathan is often under-appreciated in fanfic
[01:33] <Mouserocks> Congrats, folcs! all such excellent stories! I was so torn...
[01:33] <AntiKryptoni> Congratulations, DC, on that story--loved the look into Clark's mind!
[01:33] <VickiM> Thanks :)
[01:33] <AntiKryptoni> Thanks, Mozartmaid and Iolanthe1
[01:34] <ChiefPam> lol
[01:34] <IolantheAlia> Lois already has three Kerths!
[01:34] <mozartmaid> lol
[01:34] <VickiM> LOL
[01:34] <Mouserocks> LOL! Michael!
[01:34] <ChiefPam> now watch, the envelope will explode
[01:34] <mozartmaid> ha ha ha
[01:34] <Meadowlark> or shine a bright light
[01:34] <hachiban> Lois's garbage will explode.
[01:34] <Classicalla> And... and... and...
[01:34] <ChiefPam> lol Nan
[01:34] <LynnSM> Congrats, ML!
[01:34] <VickiM> Congrats Bob!
[01:34] <mozartmaid> Conrats ML!
[01:35] <VickiM> Congrats ML
[01:35] <IolantheAlia> Congrats MLT!
[01:35] <hachiban> Yay ML!
[01:35] <CarolM> Go ML!
[01:35] <VickiM> lol
[01:35] <ChiefPam> Yay, ML!!!
[01:35] <Corrina> Congrats ML
[01:35] <mozartmaid> ConGrats
[01:35] <AlishaK2> yay, congrats ML!!
[01:35] <Mouserocks> Congrats ML! Fantastic tale!
[01:35] <VickiM> see what happens when I type and talk to hubby at the same time?
[01:35] <LynnSM> Three guesses on your husband's name?
[01:35] <Becky__> Way to go!
[01:35] * for_Michael is now known as amberlea
[01:35] <KarenT> congrats, ML!
[01:35] <LynnSM> Or should that be, "fantastic tail"?
[01:35] <VickiM> it's Chris, but I saw the B from blind and just typed :P
[01:36] <VickiM> *sigh*
[01:36] <LynnSM> Oops. I guess I would have needed guesses two and three, then.
[01:36] <VickiM> lol
[01:36] <Mouserocks> haha!
[01:36] <LynnSM> BRB. DS needs me.
[01:36] <VickiM> I've been exposed to the Chris on IRC for far too long - my typoitis is fatal
[01:36] <Mouserocks> yes, it was a fantastic tail as well.
[01:36] <LynnSM> I'm back. He's OK.
[01:37] <IolantheAlia> Mouse - "fantastic tail" - I'm guessing you're referring to Shadow the Guide Dog in MLT's story?  Hee hee!
[01:37] <LynnSM> Yup. That's what I was thinking.
[01:38] <hachiban> ML will be happy. Maybe this will induce her to write more stories.
[01:38] <Mouserocks> hopefully. 
[01:38] <IolantheAlia> I hope so.
[01:38] * Mouserocks crosses fingers
[01:38] <LynnSM> Fingers crossed.
[01:38] <Meadowlark> Yes, more ML!
[01:40] <VickiM> Yep, some really great dramas this year. :)
[01:40] <hachiban> Yesss! Best Drama! The kind of story I love to write. too bad I didn't get the vampire fic finished before the end of the year. <cackle>
[01:40] <mozartmaid> Is A-Plot the story of the week and B-Plot the relationship (or longer story arc)? I get that mixed up...
[01:41] <ChiefPam> there's always next year, Nan <g>
[01:41] <ChiefPam> Um, but you should finish it well before the end of the year!!!
[01:41] <LynnSM> You got it right, MM
[01:41] <mozartmaid> thanks Lynn
[01:41] <hachiban> I'm working on it! Really! I hope to post the next part tomorrow.
[01:41] <ChiefPam> yay!
[01:41] <IolantheAlia> Yay Nan!
[01:42] <ChiefPam> sounds like an awesome story, AK
[01:42] <AntiKryptoni> Ah, thanks!
[01:42] <VickiM> AK's is awesome
[01:42] <LynnSM> I have to head off for about ten minutes or so. Time to get my son ready for bed.
[01:42] <mozartmaid> Everywhere -- great fic
[01:42] <VickiM> LOVED Distraught too
[01:43] <mozartmaid> Distraught was good, but got a little too dark for me
[01:43] <IolantheAlia> This was one of the hardest categories to make a choice in.
[01:43] <VickiM> Me too,Io
[01:43] <mozartmaid> The other shoe was SO fun!
[01:43] <ChiefPam> Yes, it was great
[01:43] <hachiban> dum...dum...dum... Now the traditional dragging out of the suspense.
[01:43] <IolantheAlia> Agree
[01:44] <Mouserocks> woah! stop multitasking, almost missed my own category!
[01:44] <ChiefPam> lol
[01:44] <VickiM> lol Mouse
[01:44] <KarenT> hehe
[01:44] <IolantheAlia> Congrats AK!
[01:44] <ChiefPam> Congrats, AK!
[01:44] <mozartmaid> yay!! congrats Anti-K!
[01:44] <AlishaK2> well done anti-k
[01:44] <hachiban> Yay AK!
[01:44] <Mouserocks> Congratulations, Anti-K!
[01:44] <VickiM> Wahoo!  Congrats, AntiK!!!
[01:44] * VickiM cheers wildly
[01:44] <AntiKryptoni> Wow, thanks!!!
[01:45] <Corrina> cool - that was one of my favourite stories this year!
[01:45] <Classicalla> Congrats Anti-K!
[01:45] <IolantheAlia> I liked the slow buildup - at first, Lois is totally taken in by the clone.  But slowly, carefully, certainly... she sees the light.
[01:45] <ChiefPam> spoilers! <g>
[01:45] <Mouserocks> I loved that story! So deliciously dark and dramatic!
[01:45] <IolantheAlia> Whoops, sorry.  No spoilage meant.
[01:46] <VickiM> lol
[01:46] <ChiefPam> s'okay, I like spoilers
[01:46] <IolantheAlia> OK, then I'll go out on a limb and say that Clark slowly heals as well!
[01:46] <Corrina> And the title is a little bit of a spoiler
[01:47] <ChiefPam> Excellent speech
[01:47] <AntiKryptoni> LOL! Thanks, guys! Glad you enjoyed it enough to vote for me!
[01:47] <mozartmaid> aw. great speech
[01:47] <VickiM> Excellent speech, AntiK!
[01:47] <hachiban> Great speech!
[01:47] <Mouserocks> Fantastic speech!
[01:47] <LynnSM> I'm back. Congrats, Anti-K. I knew you'd win at least one more Kerth before the night was out!
[01:47] <ChiefPam> Oh, I'm sure there will be more to come...
[01:48] * AntiKryptoni blushes
[01:48] <ChiefPam> hey, enjoy it, you worked hard for this! :)
[01:49] <Classicalla> Clark and Lois.  That's a good thing.
[01:49] <ChiefPam> lemme guess -- alt/else
[01:49] <VickiM> lol
[01:50] <AntiKryptoni> VERY Elseworlds!
[01:50] <ChiefPam> The end.
[01:50] <ChiefPam> Cute, Amber!!
[01:50] <Corrina> I thought we'd done the 'Super Short' category already
[01:50] <VickiM> lol Corrina
[01:50] <AntiKryptoni> LOL!
[01:50] <ChiefPam> oh, I was wrong... Relationship category!
[01:50] <IolantheAlia> :)
[01:50] <Mouserocks> Haha!
[01:51] <mozartmaid> I loved Choc Lab :)
[01:52] <IolantheAlia> thanks.  Actually I just re-read MMKent on my nook this afternoon!
[01:52] <AntiKryptoni> Chocolate Lab--the scene with the green eggs and ham gets me everytime!
[01:52] <mozartmaid> :D
[01:52] <IolantheAlia> TMTY - a great story!
[01:52] <VickiM> Chocolate Lab was great :)
[01:52] <IolantheAlia> Thanks!
[01:52] <mozartmaid> and TMTY was awesome!
[01:52] <Mouserocks> Heehee. Tiramisu. ;)
[01:52] <LynnSM> Congratulations, Corrina.
[01:52] <ChiefPam> woo-hoo, yay, Corrina!
[01:52] <mozartmaid> so could have predicted that! ;)
[01:52] <IolantheAlia> Congrats Corrina!  A well-deserved victory!
[01:52] <VickiM> Congrats, Corrina!!!
[01:52] <mozartmaid> congrats Corrina!!
[01:52] <LynnSM> TMTY will stay with me for a long time to come. It was phenomenal.
[01:52] <Mouserocks> Congrats, Corrina! Fabulous story!! loved it!
[01:53] <hachiban> Congrats again! You're running up quite a record!
[01:53] <Classicalla> Congratulations, Corrina1
[01:53] <AntiKryptoni> Congratulations to all the nominees--tons of good stories here! And congratulations, Female Hawk!
[01:53] <AlishaK2> well done Corrina!
[01:53] <IolantheAlia> I remember when Corrina sent me the first chapter for beta - Clark, locked up by the government agency - watched, tortured - it hooked me right from the first word!
[01:53] <Becky__> Way to go!
[01:53] <LynnSM> I agree completely, Io. I felt the same way.
[01:53] <IolantheAlia> I still wonder about that Clark and I wonder how much PTSD he has.
[01:53] <mozartmaid> so true
[01:54] <LynnSM> If anyone can help him with that, it's Lois.
[01:54] <ChiefPam> See, that's the kind of story that's too much stress for me to deal with... but I did read a few chapters in the middle, somewhere :)
[01:54] <mozartmaid> good point. that story stays with you
[01:54] <IolantheAlia> Pam, now that it's complete, take an afternoon (or maybe two or three) and read the whole thing!
[01:55] <ChiefPam> I may have to do that!
[01:55] <mozartmaid> yes, it's totally worth it!
[01:55] * ChiefPam writes down all sorts of stories to read...
[01:55] <Meadowlark> Sorry, but I am with you, Pam, don't care for torture stories
[01:55] <LynnSM> It does have a start that is painful to get through -- Clark is in such a horrible place -- but the story is well worth reading. Things do get better.
[01:55] <LynnSM> And this from someone who usually tries to avaoid WHAM-my fiction.
[01:56] <ChiefPam> Well, I just read the Hunger Games series, so I can't claim to always need to have happy endings :)
[01:56] <Classicalla> I haven't read it, but it sounds very interesting.  I'll put it on my "to do" list.
[01:56] * Mouserocks jumps up and down at the chance to read and re-read angst!
[01:56] <IolantheAlia> TMTY - well worth reading!
[01:56] <ChiefPam> My fandom eats angst for breakfast
[01:56] <AntiKryptoni> LOL!
[01:56] * VickiM applauds for Corrina
[01:58] <Mouserocks> Good speech, Corrina!
[01:58] <ChiefPam> lol
[01:58] <IolantheAlia> I hope this is "Clark in a swimsuit"
[01:58] <ChiefPam> Speedos, yum
[01:58] <LynnSM> Yum.
[01:58] <AntiKryptoni> Very nice speech, FH!
[01:58] <KarenT> lol
[01:58] <mozartmaid> he he, me too Iolanthe
[01:58] * VickiM drools
[01:58] <Mouserocks> lol! me too!
[01:58] <mozartmaid> *thatchest*
[01:58] <AMCiotola> lag?
[01:58] <LynnSM> Or maybe just the red trunks? Skip the rest of the Suit.
[01:59] <Mouserocks> are we comparing best supermen?
[01:59] <IolantheAlia> I want to see beefcake!~
[01:59] <Mouserocks> Here, here!
[01:59] <Classicalla> Ooohhh....  Yes, that chest.  
[01:59] * amberlea is now known as for_Virginia
[01:59] <Mouserocks> ... And those arms...
[01:59] <LynnSM> "thatchest" -- the best password ever (if not the most secure).
[02:00] <mozartmaid> lol
[02:00] <KarenT> oh,k you asked for it
[02:00] <Mouserocks> hahaha!!
[02:00] <LynnSM> A WONDERful island.
[02:00] <IolantheAlia> :)
[02:00] <LynnSM> But I don't like the male-to-female ratio there.
[02:01] * Mouserocks adjusts password to laptop
[02:01] <hachiban> Not to mention, one of the princesses may decide to kill you if she likes your husband....
[02:01] <Classicalla> Themyscira?  Oh, my.  Where is this going?
[02:01] * VirginiaR has joined #kerthchat
[02:01] <IolantheAlia> Hi Virginia! 
[02:01] * Becky__ has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[02:01] <ChiefPam> hey, Virginia, good speech
[02:01] <ChiefPam> err, commercial
[02:01] <KarenT> actually, you know what? that sounds like a great vacation!
[02:01] <Mouserocks> Hi, virginia!
[02:01] <Mouserocks> Good commercial(s)!
[02:01] <hachiban> Lois didn't think so...
[02:02] <ChiefPam> it does, Karen!
[02:02] <Classicalla> Watch out, Diana!  Lois will come after you!
[02:02] * for_Virginia is now known as amberlea
[02:02] <ChiefPam> leave the kids and husband at home... <g>
[02:02] <KarenT> oh yeah
[02:02] <VirginiaR> Thanks, can anyone tell me how to open a second chat room so I can see the awards too
[02:02] * Becky__ has joined #kerthchat
[02:03] <KarenT>   /join #kerthawards
[02:03] <ChiefPam> My name is Inigo Montoya
[02:03] <LynnSM> Sorry, Virginia. Unless you are using Trillian, I can't help you.
[02:03] <Mouserocks> You killed my father. Prepare to DIE!
[02:03] <LynnSM> Prepare to die?
[02:03] <ChiefPam> Now, we do alt/else.  This might be my favorite category...
[02:03] <VickiM> Hi Virginia!
[02:04] <VirginiaR> Okay, thanks Karen, I'm logged in.
[02:04] <hachiban> Just open the list and click on #kerthawards. Then shrink your windows down so you can see both of them.
[02:05] <ChiefPam> will it last?  I'm betting not
[02:05] <ChiefPam> wouldn't be much of a story if it did <g>
[02:05] <Mouserocks> Nope. :P
[02:05] <AntiKryptoni> That's a great story, mozartmaid!
[02:05] <Mouserocks> Agreed!
[02:06] <mozartmaid> thanks. I think I wrote it for Iolanthe during the ficathon? Do u remember your requirements for it?
[02:06] * VirginiaR has quit IRC (Signed off)
[02:06] <IolantheAlia> I'm afraid not!
[02:06] <mozartmaid> I remember yogurt :)
[02:06] <mozartmaid> or rather, NO yogurt, I think
[02:06] <IolantheAlia> I think I *didn't* want yogurt, for some reason.  Not sure why now.  I've actually developed a taste for that Greek yogurt.
[02:06] <mozartmaid> lol
[02:07] <LynnSM> You're competing against yourself, MM. Congratulations.
[02:07] <IolantheAlia> Hey Classicalla - I think that the second fic is actually Virginia's "Missing Lois"
[02:07] <mozartmaid> ha ha, I know. Although, "secretly" Mr Mrs Kent is my fav story I've written so far
[02:08] <mozartmaid> um, no that wasn't the plot to that one...
[02:08] <mozartmaid> that was my other story --
[02:08] <LynnSM> It does sound like Virginia's ML
[02:08] <mozartmaid> Prisoners
[02:09] <mozartmaid> I had to go look up the title... 
[02:09] <IolantheAlia> Missing Lois - I remember this for the plethora of Loises
[02:09] <mozartmaid> Mr and Mrs Kent used the premise from Mr. and Mrs. Smith, but Clark and Lois meet in the Congo with their secrets -- Lois is an assasin, coerced, I might add
[02:09] <ChiefPam> luckily, Virginia timed out
[02:09] <VickiM> lol
[02:09] <IolantheAlia> There was canon Lois, canon past Lois, canon present Lois, alt-Lois, clone canon Lois, and clone alt-Lois, as I recall.
[02:09] <ChiefPam> ooh, cool <g>
[02:10] <Becky__> Sorry to have to leave-hate to miss the after party
[02:10] * VickiM 's head just exploded from so many Loises
[02:10] <Dernit> well I need to go, good to see some of you again, hopefully I'll be around a bit more
[02:10] <Becky__> Bye all!
[02:10] <LynnSM> Lois was multiplying like tribbles!
[02:10] <IolantheAlia> Bye!
[02:10] <VickiM> LOL
[02:10] <ChiefPam> Night!
[02:10] <VickiM> Bye!
[02:10] <LynnSM> Bye Becky and Dernit.
[02:10] <mozartmaid> ok THAT one is Mr. and Mrs. Kent
[02:10] <mozartmaid> lol
[02:10] <IolantheAlia> Yes, when you get into the past and the alt-world and the clone Loises, there are quite a few Loises
[02:11] <mozartmaid> yes indeedy :)
[02:11] * Dernit has quit IRC (Signed off)
[02:11] * VirginiaR has joined #kerthchat
[02:11] <VickiM> welcome back, Virginia
[02:11] <LynnSM> Welcome back.
[02:12] <AntiKryptoni> That's an amazing story, Corrina! Love it!
[02:12] <ChiefPam> welcome back & good luck!
[02:12] <Corrina> maybe we should have another ficathon soon - as ficathon stories seem to get lots of nomintions
[02:12] <Mouserocks> back
[02:12] <LynnSM> Feel better, Nancy.
[02:12] <mozartmaid> they are fun!
[02:12] * Mouserocks has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:12] <IolantheAlia> Congrats Corrina!
[02:12] <VickiM> Congrats, Corrina!!!
[02:12] * Mouserocks has joined #kerthchat
[02:12] <mozartmaid> congrats Corrina!
[02:12] <LynnSM> Congratulations, Corrina!
[02:12] <AntiKryptoni> Congratulations, Corrina!
[02:13] <AlishaK2> Well done Corrina
[02:13] <LynnSM> I'm guessing TMTY will also win the Best Overall.
[02:13] <Mouserocks> back again :) Congrats Corrina!
[02:13] <ChiefPam> Congrats, Corrina!
[02:13] * Classicalla shakes head in embarrassment.
[02:13] <mozartmaid> I'm fading... 2AM - will power to make it to the end!
[02:13] <IolantheAlia> I think Corrina needs to install special lighted shelves to hold all her Kerth awards.  /grin/
[02:13] <Classicalla> I'm glad I had the good sense to glance at the chat.  Thanks...
[02:13] <mozartmaid> lol
[02:13] * ChiefPam sends MM some expresso
[02:13] <mozartmaid> thanks!
[02:13] <VickiM> or an addition onto her place - a whole new room :)
[02:13] <LynnSM> I think she'd need not just one or two shelves -- she'd need a whole bookcase.
[02:14] <LynnSM> Maybe a wall.
[02:14] <hachiban> Congrats!
[02:14] <ChiefPam> Ask Nan what she does with all of hers <g>
[02:14] <hachiban> Sorry to be late. I drank too much tea before the ceremony and I'm paying for it now. <sigh>
[02:14] <LynnSM> A whole new room would work, too. Give her room for next year's Kerths.
[02:14] <VirginiaR> I totally missed that as MIRC keeps disappearing on me.  What did Corrina just win?
[02:15] <ChiefPam> Best Alt/Else for Trusting Me, Trusting you
[02:15] <AlishaK2> I think you're doing well mm, I'm half asleep here meself!
[02:15] <LynnSM> And it was worth every word.
[02:15] <VirginiaR> Congrats!  That's a great fic!
[02:15] <mozartmaid> I'm presenting BNA
[02:15] <mozartmaid>  after that, I think I'll sign off
[02:15] <LynnSM> If you fall asleep before then, I'll try to give your half, too...
[02:16] <KarenT> okay, I"m not able to make it through the rest of the ceremony. I'll stay connected, though
[02:16] <LynnSM> There is only one more category after that. Best overall.
[02:16] <mozartmaid> thanks Lynn. we have only one more category till ours though. I think I'll make it
[02:16] <mozartmaid> jinx
[02:16] <mozartmaid> :P
[02:16] <KarenT> have a good night, everyone!
[02:16] <LynnSM> <chuckle>
[02:16] <mozartmaid> night!
[02:16] <VickiM> night Karen
[02:16] <ChiefPam> take care, Karen
[02:16] <AntiKryptoni> Good night!
[02:16] <LynnSM> Good night, Karen.
[02:16] <IolantheAlia> Good night!
[02:16] <AlishaK2> night Karen
[02:17] <hachiban> night K
[02:17] <AMCiotola> Night Karen
[02:17] <VirginiaR> Thanks for all your help!
[02:17] <AntiKryptoni> Nice speech, Corrina!
[02:17] <hachiban> I have a 16 pound cat trying to worm his way behind my monitor. He keeps walking on my keyboard.
[02:17] <VickiM> Quite lovely :)
[02:17] <VickiM> lol Nan
[02:17] <mozartmaid> 400k words -- impressive, Corrina!
[02:18] <Corrina> Thanks, Anti-K
[02:18] <LynnSM> If we see some random letters coming from you, we'll know why.
[02:18] <mozartmaid> and every word counted 
[02:18] <mozartmaid> very deliberate
[02:18] <Corrina> Yay Iolanthe
[02:18] <Classicalla> Hello, Iolanthe.
[02:18] <VirginiaR> I tried to write a commercial / newsbreak for it, but I kept getting sucked back into the story and 2 hours later... :-) Nada written.  Apologies!
[02:19] <ChiefPam> "For the best in government torture..."
[02:19] <Mouserocks> Night, Karen!
[02:19] <ChiefPam> That is odd, indeed
[02:19] <ChiefPam> lol
[02:20] <mozartmaid> lol
[02:20] <LynnSM> <GROAN>
[02:20] <AlishaK2> groan
[02:20] <VickiM> lol
[02:20] <VirginiaR> Anyone have a face-palm smilie handy?
[02:20] <Corrina> LOL
[02:20] <mozartmaid> Lynn, are you going first or am I?
[02:20] <LynnSM> I am.
[02:20] <AlishaK2> I'm not sure I'm done groaning, actually
[02:20] <mozartmaid> k, thought so
[02:21] * Becky__ has quit IRC (Signed off)
[02:21] <VirginiaR> Is this where we clap?
[02:21] <LynnSM> Shadow's a terrific character.
[02:21] * Mouserocks claps wildly
[02:21] <Mouserocks> Yay, Shadow!
[02:21] <Classicalla> I love stories with animals!
[02:21] <Mouserocks> (and by extension, ML) ;)
[02:22] <mozartmaid> :)
[02:22] <VirginiaR> Anyone who would make Lois kick Clark out of bed must be a good character.
[02:22] <LynnSM> Was he the butt of a lot of jokes?
[02:22] <mozartmaid> high-hat
[02:22] <mozartmaid> as in on a drum
[02:22] <Meadowlark> Loved Shadow
[02:22] <AntiKryptoni> LOL!
[02:22] <ChiefPam> oh, that's awful
[02:22] <Mouserocks> HAHA! terrible...
[02:22] <LynnSM> Ugh.
[02:22] <AlishaK2> Told you I wasn't done groaning...
[02:22] * VickiM groans
[02:22] <Corrina> Iolanthe - you need to write comedy!
[02:22] <VirginiaR> Iolanthe, what??
[02:23] <mozartmaid> lol
[02:23] * VickiM groans again
[02:23] * mib_4wfb87 has joined #kerthchat
[02:23] <Mouserocks> Ba-dum-bum!
[02:23] <VirginiaR> Gee, I was going to guess LexLabs
[02:23] * ChiefPam joins the groaning chorus
[02:23] <Mouserocks> lol!
[02:23] <mozartmaid> ha ha, touche Virgina
[02:23] <IolantheAlia> Actually that's quite a good response, Virginia!
[02:24] <VirginiaR> Yea!!! Lynn!!
[02:24] <ChiefPam> okay, that one I have to read...
[02:24] <lncroxmysox> Haha, the explanation we were all waiting for since 1994
[02:24] <mozartmaid> this was brilliant Lynn!
[02:24] <VickiM> How did I miss that one?
[02:24] <LynnSM> Thanks!
[02:24] <Mouserocks> Perfect explanation, Lynn! Loved it!
[02:24] * mib_4wfb87 has quit IRC (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[02:25] <LynnSM> I am happy to report that my son, whose egg allergy inspired the story, has since outgrown the allergy.
[02:25] <VirginiaR> Um... DC, you were too busy have Lois hit Clark with a 2x4
[02:25] <LynnSM> And he *loves* eggs. Especially hard boiled. :)
[02:25] <mozartmaid> hmm... fanfic works miraculous cures? :D
[02:25] <VickiM> good for him. :)  Yay!
[02:25] <ChiefPam> Not even a raisin!
[02:25] <AlishaK2> Hey!
[02:25] <VickiM> Virginia, you'll be happy to know that I am posting chapter 10 after the Kerths - a few hours early :)
[02:25] <Mouserocks> hahha! ouch!
[02:25] <Meadowlark> Oh, a joke, like a raisen  
[02:26] <lncroxmysox> Woe is Jimmy
[02:26] <mozartmaid> lol
[02:26] * AlishaK2 is looking for her royalty cheque
[02:26] <VirginiaR> I loved Alisha Raisen joke!
[02:26] <VickiM> lol
[02:26] <mozartmaid> getting a lot of mileage out of that raisin ;)
[02:26] <Mouserocks> lol!
[02:26] <LynnSM> Where's the punch line?
[02:27] <VickiM> The raisin heard 'round the world :)
[02:27] <VirginiaR> I think it slid onto the floor, Lynn
[02:27] <mozartmaid> lol

[02:27] <IolantheAlia> Groan!

[02:27] <mozartmaid> Fozzie! Love it!
[02:27] <hachiban> Oy!
[02:27] <VirginiaR> Well, Io, at least you didn't go to Clark's.  If he can't tell regular vision from Supes...
[02:28] <mozartmaid> wacka wacka wacka!
[02:28] * VickiM offers Mouse a cracker to help with the cheese
[02:28] <Classicalla> You are a riot, Iolanthe.
[02:28] <LynnSM> And no Waldorf or Statler around anywhere.
[02:28] <IolantheAlia> amberlea - how did you guess?
[02:28] <VirginiaR> Yeah, Cheese of the Montha, anyone?
[02:28] <VirginiaR> <<ducking>>
[02:28] <ChiefPam> lol
[02:28] <amberlea> because Fozzie jokes are awesome, of course!  :)
[02:28] <VickiM> oooh, gouda one, Virginia ;)
[02:29] <mozartmaid> lol
[02:29] <ChiefPam> lol, Vicki
[02:29] <lncroxmysox> Okay you all are getting out of hand

[02:29] <Mouserocks> lol! 
[02:29] <Mouserocks> and its not even late enough for me to be punchy yet!
[02:29] <VickiM> same here, Mouse ;)
[02:29] <VirginiaR> WoL was terrific!
[02:30] * lncroxmysox takes AWAY the silverware

[02:30] <CarolM> groan
[02:30] <mozartmaid> sax and violins -- rolls eyes
[02:30] * Mouserocks mutters about when dinner's ready
[02:30] <VirginiaR> LOL, Io
[02:30] <IolantheAlia> I've been collecting corny jokes all year!
[02:30] <VirginiaR> Must be all the holes, Robin

[02:30] <VickiM> lol
[02:30] <Mouserocks> LOL!
[02:30] <VirginiaR> Keep looking, Io, I'm sure you'll find one
[02:30] <mozartmaid> how punny ;)
[02:30] <AntiKryptoni> Are you stalling because they lost the envelope, Iolanthe? :)
[02:31] <ChiefPam> okay, that one was funny <g>
[02:31] <Classicalla> Nope.  Envelope not lost.  
[02:31] <mozartmaid> this was a cute fic
[02:31] * Mouserocks puts down the torch
[02:32] <VirginiaR> Thanks
[02:32] <LynnSM> Not often we see a story written in Perry's POV. This was a good one.
[02:32] <mozartmaid> ooh good word!
[02:32] <VickiM> was saying before that Yodeler's Song was one of the first I read on the boards, if memory serves, Virginia
[02:32] <AntiKryptoni> Good story, Virginia!
[02:32] <Classicalla> Yep, I always figured Perry figured it out when he saw Clark trying to go out the window in the supply room.
[02:32] <VirginiaR> Well, at least I didn't scare Vicki away, phew!
[02:32] <VickiM> lol nope - hard to scare me away when I enjoy torturing characters :)
[02:32] <LynnSM> Ugh.
[02:33] <hachiban> Agh!
[02:33] <AntiKryptoni> Oh for crying out loud...
[02:33] * VickiM groans
[02:33] <Mouserocks> XD
[02:33] * ChiefPam hands out pitchforks
[02:33] <VickiM> lol
[02:33] * lncroxmysox takes one
[02:33] * AlishaK2 wonders why she's stayed up for these jokes
[02:33] <LynnSM> LOL. Good one.
[02:33] <AntiKryptoni> Thanks, Pan, I was looking for one of these.
[02:33] * mozartmaid wonders the same, Alisha ;)
[02:33] <hachiban> My torch won'l light ...
[02:33] <ChiefPam> Mouse is in charge of the torches
[02:33] <Mouserocks> LOL! I think the responses are funnier than some of the jokes...
[02:34] <VickiM> oh no!  you gave Mouse the power of fire????
[02:34] <AntiKryptoni> Here's a match.
[02:34] <IolantheAlia> I agree, and I'm telling the jokes!
[02:34] <lncroxmysox> Are the Kerths always longer than the Oscars?
[02:34] <Mouserocks> Torches, get your torches here!
[02:34] <VirginiaR> I'll take one Mouse
[02:34] <LynnSM> The jokes are matchless.
[02:34] <mozartmaid> I think I missed BSB by MLT. will put on to-read list...
[02:34] * VickiM puts on The Mob Song from Beauty and the Beast
[02:34] <AntiKryptoni> Give me a few--my family wants some as well.
[02:34] <AntiKryptoni> Great one, Vicki!
[02:34] <Mouserocks> I'm a dangerous one with fire. I'm deviously evil enough already. 
[02:34] * ChiefPam hums along...
[02:34] <AntiKryptoni> Kill the beast!
[02:34] <VickiM> lol
[02:34] <Mouserocks> you dont need to fan my flames... XD
[02:35] <AntiKryptoni> Here's a belated LOL, Lynn!
[02:35] <lncroxmysox> ...
[02:35] <AMCiotola> Boy, the dragging things out never gets old ...
[02:35] <ChiefPam> tough category apparently
[02:36] <LynnSM> Congratulations, ML!
[02:36] <ChiefPam> Congrats, ML!!
[02:36] <lncroxmysox> Canines rule!
[02:36] <VickiM> Congrats, ML and Shadow!
[02:36] <mozartmaid> congrats ML
[02:36] <AlishaK2> Congrats ML
[02:36] <Corrina> Congrats, MLT
[02:36] <LynnSM> The rest of us didn't stand a dog of a chance!
[02:36] <mozartmaid> woof!
[02:36] <VirginiaR> Yea! Shadow!
[02:36] <hachiban> Congrats ML! Loved Shadow!
[02:36] <AntiKryptoni> Go, dogs!
[02:36] <Mouserocks> Congrats ML! Loved Shadow! 
[02:36] <Classicalla> Congrats!!
[02:36] <Meadowlark> Great presentation, Iolanthe!
[02:36] <IolantheAlia> Congrats, ML!
[02:36] <Mouserocks> Agreed- great presentation!
[02:36] <ChiefPam> So I guess we can put down the pitchforks now...
[02:36] <Corrina> Is this the first time an animal has won a Kerth? Well,  ML won it, but you know what I mean
[02:37] * Mouserocks reluctantly puts aside torches
[02:37] <Corrina> Iolanthe - you've just shown everyone that you should be writing more
[02:37] <VickiM> lol good thing, Pam - I just burnt myself on the torch :p
[02:37] <ChiefPam> Might be.  Though I remember Meredith Knight did a great job with a ficus one year...
[02:37] <VickiM> Io, you need to crank out some comedy stories :)
[02:37] <Classicalla> Can't wait to see the presentation that Lynn and MozartMaid have for us!
[02:38] <IolantheAlia> Thanks.  But all my jokes were plagiarized from Fozzie Bear.
[02:38] <Mouserocks> Yes! Please! I'm a sucker for cheese! (if you couldnt tell)
[02:38] <Meadowlark> Wasnt there a story from the POV of Lois' fish one year?
[02:38] <ChiefPam> Probably
[02:38] <lncroxmysox> There was one from her cat once I remember:)
[02:38] <VirginiaR> Is that because you're a mouse, Mouse?
[02:38] <IolantheAlia> LOL
[02:38] <VickiM> lol
[02:39] <lncroxmysox> This was the toughest category this year.
[02:39] <Mouserocks> Haha! Didn't even catch that one!
[02:39] <lncroxmysox> For me.
[02:39] <VickiM> Congrats on the nom, AntiK!
[02:39] <Mouserocks> Both of you deserve a hearty congrats!
[02:39] <Classicalla> Congrats to the noms!
[02:39] <IolantheAlia> I wanted to split my vote and vote for both of them, but the darn voting form wouldn't allow it!
[02:40] <AntiKryptoni> Congrats to you, Vicki!
[02:40] <ChiefPam> Xena crossover, lol
[02:40] * VickiM hugs AntiK as the tension mounts :)
[02:40] <AMCiotola> I do that on purpose, Io ;)
[02:40] <VirginiaR> I figured Anti-K had been here for years, her stuff is so good!
[02:40] <lncroxmysox> Whoever wins I want MORE FICS out of both of you ASAP!
[02:40] <IolantheAlia> Yes, it would probably be a pain to have to count half-votes
[02:41] <VickiM> lol LNC
[02:41] <IolantheAlia> I agree with lncroxmysox
[02:41] * lncroxmysox rolls drums
[02:41] * Mouserocks considers embezzling half votes in the style of "Superman 3"
[02:41] <VirginiaR> DC, you always keep me on my toes (especially during Xena crossover)
[02:41] <VickiM> Wahoo!!!! You go, girl!!!!
[02:41] <lncroxmysox> Yayyy!
[02:41] <IolantheAlia> Congrats AK!  And congrats DC!
[02:41] <ChiefPam> Congrats to both of you for being nominated

[02:42] <hachiban> Congratulations to both new authors!
[02:42] <Mouserocks> Congrats, Anti-K! and to DC! both so deserving!

[02:42] <lncroxmysox> You guys rock!
[02:42] <AntiKryptoni> Thank you! Thanks to all of you--I really don't know what to say. I can't believe Vicki didn't get this!
[02:42] <Corrina> And congrats also to Vicki
[02:42] <lncroxmysox> *applause*
[02:43] <ChiefPam> Seriously, without awesome new writers coming in, this fandom would have died off years ago.  You're both terrific additions to the fandom.
[02:43] <mozartmaid> ok, kids, it's been fun, but I must sign off!
[02:43] <ChiefPam> night!
[02:43] <VickiM> aww, thanks guys :)

[02:43] <LynnSM> Good night, MM. It was fun co-presenting.
[02:43] <hachiban> night!
[02:43] <mozartmaid> night all!
[02:43] <AntiKryptoni> Good night, mozartmaid! Thanks for the great presentation!
[02:43] <AlishaK2> night MM
[02:43] <AntiKryptoni> Thanks, Lynn, for your wonderfully kind words!
[02:43] <IolantheAlia> Good night Mozartmaid!  
[02:43] <Mouserocks> Nite, MM!
[02:43] <ChiefPam> great speech
[02:43] <AMCiotola> night Mozartmaid
[02:43] <VirginiaR> Congrats, Anti-K!
[02:43] <mozartmaid> thanks -- congrats Anti-K on all your awards tonight! well-deserved!
[02:43] <Chrispat> Congrats to all the winners and nominees :)
[02:43] <mozartmaid> thanks!
[02:44] <VickiM> Beautiful speech, AntiK!
[02:44] <mozartmaid> have fun all... I will try to come by the boards more often ;)
[02:44] <Mouserocks> Good speech, Anti-K!
[02:44] <ChiefPam> so you should
[02:44] <LynnSM> Aw. Another wonderful speech.
[02:44] <Mouserocks> please do, MM!
[02:44] <hachiban> Good speech!
[02:44] <VickiM> AntiK is going to need a new addition to her house for all of the shiny awards
[02:44] <ChiefPam> (says the person who's rarely seen there anymore...)
[02:44] <mozartmaid> lol Pam
[02:44] * amberlea is now known as for_Virginia
[02:44] <mozartmaid>  I do have a fic I started that Corrina started to beta... maybe this will nudge me to take another stab at it ;)
[02:45] <IolantheAlia> YES!
[02:45] <AntiKryptoni> Thanks, everyone--I couldn't get this far without you!
[02:45] <LynnSM> If it doesn't, then how about this? NUDGE, NUDGE!
[02:45] <Corrina> I was going to suggest you get back to that!
[02:45] <mozartmaid> ha ha, thanks guys!
[02:45] <hachiban> Sorry about the spotty posts. I'm trying to multitask. Dog needed out, cat needed food, fixing hair to take my brother bowling and attend the Kerths. Argh!
[02:45] <VickiM> AntiK is also a wonderful beta reader, not just the Best New Author :)
[02:45] <mozartmaid> we'll see how the muse does with a little nudging ;)
[02:45] <AntiKryptoni> Wow, Vicki, I need to hire you as my publicist!
[02:46] <VickiM> LOL!
[02:46] <LynnSM> I'll second that. She gave me some really good pointers on the fic I've been working on off and on all year.
[02:46] <Mouserocks> Woo-hoo! 
[02:46] <mozartmaid> ok, night for real now! ;)
[02:46] <AntiKryptoni> Seriously, I wish we could have tied on this award! Love your stories!
[02:46] * mozartmaid has left #kerthchat
[02:46] * Mouserocks drools at Virginia's commercial
[02:46] <AntiKryptoni> Wow, thanks, Lynn--glad the comments helped!
[02:46] <VickiM> awww, thanks hun!
[02:46] <VickiM> lol @ commerical
[02:47] <IolantheAlia> "non-defunct newspaper"?  LOL
[02:47] <Classicalla> I think Virginia should post these commercials as little mini-fics!
[02:47] * AMCiotola has quit IRC (Signed off)
[02:47] <Mouserocks> Seconded!
[02:48] <VirginiaR> <<blushing>> uh... gee... thanks. :-)
[02:48] <ChiefPam> too good for you, lol
[02:48] <AntiKryptoni> Great commercial--but shouldn't we have a boycott on Luthor? :)
[02:48] * AMCiotola has joined #kerthchat
[02:48] <VickiM> Ditto that, Classicalla
[02:48] * ChiefPam has quit IRC (Signed off)
[02:48] <LynnSM> I guess that's one place Clark does *not* shop for his ties.
[02:48] * ChiefPam has joined #kerthchat
[02:49] <AMCiotola> re
[02:49] <ChiefPam> re
[02:49] * for_Virginia is now known as amberlea
[02:49] <VickiM> what?  we're supposed to boycott the sociopath?
[02:49] <AntiKryptoni> It might be recommended for your health.
[02:49] <ChiefPam> that'll just tick him off
[02:49] * Mouserocks raises hand
[02:49] <Mouserocks> I wasnt aware of that plan...
[02:49] <VickiM> lol
[02:49] <VirginiaR> Um... Actually, he does, Lynn... But that was before he knew Luthor was, well, Luthor.
[02:50] <ChiefPam> Yay, behind the scenes hard workers!
[02:50] <LynnSM> Oops.
[02:51] <IolantheAlia> Yes, thanks K-Comm!  You've done a wonderful job!
[02:51] * VickiM gives KComm a standing ovation
[02:51] <Corrina> Good point, Amber.  I'm sure many of us enjoying the ceremony have no idea what is needed to make something like this work.  Great job.
[02:51] <AMCiotola> no applause, just throw money ;)
[02:51] * LynnSM applauds
[02:51] <lncroxmysox> Yayyy
[02:51] * ChiefPam throws money
[02:51] <Mouserocks> Thank you, K-Comm!
[02:51] <AlishaK2> Thank you K-Comm
[02:51] <AntiKryptoni> Thanks, everyone! Great job!
[02:51] <VirginiaR> Anti-K, if you want to tell Luthor that we're boycotting him, I'll completely understand.  I'll miss you, but I'll understand.
[02:51] * AMCiotola catches it
[02:51] <VickiM> Thanks, KComm for making this lovely event happen!
[02:51] <ChiefPam> Thanks, K-Comm!
[02:51] <LynnSM> LOL Virginia.
[02:51] <AntiKryptoni> LOL, Vicki! I'll bring SUperman with me.
[02:51] <VickiM> lol Virginia
[02:51] <ChiefPam> lol, Virginia
[02:51] <AntiKryptoni> Maybe Lois, too--then we'll watch Luthor's downfall, literally.
[02:52] <AntiKryptoni> Virginia, I mean, sorry about that! (blushing)
[02:52] * VickiM gives Luthor a solid 6 on his swan dive off the high-rise
[02:52] <IolantheAlia> Vicki, are you grading on the diving scale or on the gymnastics scale?
[02:52] <VirginiaR> But, Vicki, he didn't scream!
[02:52] <lncroxmysox> Luthor IS a graceful jumper. Just look how he turned into a bouquet as he went down.
[02:52] <VickiM> His form was a little off ;)
[02:53] <ChiefPam> lol
[02:53] <VirginiaR> Yea, K-Comm.
[02:53] <AntiKryptoni> LOL!
[02:53] <ChiefPam> somebody snatched his body in midair
[02:53] <LynnSM> You might say that his performace was a let-down?
[02:53] <VirginiaR> LOL
[02:53] <IolantheAlia> groan
[02:53] * VickiM is laughing like a loon all alone in her den
[02:53] * Mouserocks facepalms
[02:53] <VirginiaR> Someone wanted his body?  I mean, besides Mrs. Luthor?
[02:53] <Classicalla> And thank you, Karen, for keeping everything going on IRC.  
[02:53] <LynnSM> Gretchen Kelly.
[02:54] <Mouserocks> XD
[02:54] <ChiefPam> nice haiku, Amber :)
[02:54] <VickiM> man, we are a *punchy* group tonight
[02:54] <lncroxmysox> ok we're good
[02:54] <VickiM> I love it
[02:54] <lncroxmysox> right amount of syllables
[02:54] <LynnSM> A novel approach.
[02:54] <hachiban> Never was good at haikus. 
[02:54] <ChiefPam> you counted?
[02:54] <IolantheAlia> I think next year we should demand that Amber introduce the category with a sonnet
[02:54] <LynnSM> (A very short novel.)
[02:55] <VickiM> lol, Io
[02:55] <hachiban> I'm sensing a trend.
[02:55] <VickiM> awwww
[02:55] <VirginiaR> Clark glowed in the dark for Lois?
[02:55] <lncroxmysox> He's shiny
[02:55] <VickiM> one of his lesser known abilities ;)
[02:55] <AntiKryptoni> And Then There was Light.
[02:55] <LynnSM> Must be all that solar energy he absorbed.
[02:55] <VirginiaR> He really needed a bath
[02:55] <AlishaK2> glow-in-the-dark ties
[02:55] <hachiban> His red shorts are shiny.
[02:55] <VirginiaR> LOL, Alisha
[02:56] <LynnSM> 'cause he really was smitten?
[02:56] <VickiM> lol Alisha
[02:56] <ChiefPam> lol, good rhyme for "written"
[02:56] <AntiKryptoni> LOl!
[02:56] <hachiban> lol!
[02:56] <Classicalla> We've mentioned Clark's ties.  Does anyone know how to find the site that listed his ties?  I thought it could be found on WayBack but I can't find it there.
[02:57] <VickiM> Next year, Amber should introduce it to a choergraphed dance number that is posted to youtube ;)
[02:57] <ChiefPam> lol
[02:57] <hachiban> AAAAAGH!
[02:57] <LynnSM> There was a site that listed his ties? Did it include a screen capture of each of them?
[02:57] <AntiKryptoni> Poetry Slam?
[02:57] <ChiefPam> There was a site, yeah
[02:57] <Classicalla> Yes, it did, Lynn.
[02:57] <IolantheAlia> Let's see...haiku... limerick... ode... I'm waiting for sestina!
[02:57] <VickiM> ooh, I'd be interested in that link, if someone has it
[02:57] <Mouserocks> ooh! me three!
[02:57] <LynnSM> I'd love to see that site. (What can I saw? I'm a site-see-er.)
[02:58] <ChiefPam> search for "clark kent's ties" and see what comes up
[02:58] <lncroxmysox> The Ultimate Difinitive Guide to Clark Kent's Ties:)
[02:58] <AntiKryptoni> Wheew! I mean, what a shame.
[02:58] <VickiM> badda-bam!
[02:58] <hachiban> Just as well. I'm running out of time here.
[02:58] <ChiefPam> dang, you offer me an ode,and then just pull it away...
[02:58] <LynnSM> Amber was afraid the poems would be getting "ode"?
[02:58] <VirginiaR> I liked Clark's ties <<ducking>>
[02:58] <IolantheAlia> LOL
[02:58] <Classicalla> The site usually comes up as being not available, but I used to be able to find it at Wayback.
[02:58] <Classicalla> I liked most of them, too.
[02:59] <Meadowlark> For Clark's ties try here:  http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090109100812/http://www.chantico.com/alastor/ckties/

[02:59] <VirginiaR> Yea, Anti-K!
[02:59] <IolantheAlia> I always like in fanfics when the writers make reference to Clark's ties.
[02:59] <VirginiaR> Yea, MLT!
[02:59] <lncroxmysox> Oooh someone should do a Tumblr with CK's ties, ala the Cosby Sweater Project
[02:59] <LynnSM> Oooh. The site just came up for me. I'll have to bookmark it to look at tomorrow. Thanks for the tip.

[03:01] <Classicalla> And here's at least part of the tie site: http://web.archive.org/web/20071011214739/http://chantico.com/alastor/ckties/
[03:01] <Mouserocks> Definitely. Gotta reread for fun!
[03:01] <VirginiaR> Terrific Story!  Actually, they all were/.
[03:03] <ChiefPam> We do have so many terrific authors, and more every year...
[03:04] <VirginiaR> Blame Clark.  He has a magnetic personality.
[03:04] <ChiefPam> Hah, that must be it
[03:04] <VickiM> I agree, Virginia
[03:04] <ChiefPam> And then Perry makes everybody stick to high writing standards
[03:04] <VickiM> my muse is *smitten* with him
[03:04] <ChiefPam> and Lois scares off the pretenders
[03:04] <AntiKryptoni> LOL!
[03:05] <VirginiaR> Does Jimmy do research, because sometimes, I really could use some help there?
[03:05] <ChiefPam> it may depend on which Jimmy you're talking to...
[03:05] <IolantheAlia> LOL
[03:06] <VirginiaR> YEA! to all those who FDK!
[03:06] <VickiM> Will he get us take-out to keep us fed and happy as we write?
[03:06] <AntiKryptoni> Definitely!
[03:07] <lncroxmysox> Okay now I'm hungry
[03:07] <VickiM> lol, sorry
[03:07] <LynnSM> Now, if onlu I could get him to round up my wandering muse...
[03:07] <VirginiaR> Forget research, I want take-out!  Just avoid any place with Ralph in the title, please.
[03:07] <lncroxmysox> It's dinnertime in my TZ:)
[03:07] <ChiefPam> WTG, Greg!
[03:07] <AntiKryptoni> Ahh...
[03:07] <VickiM> Lojack your muse ;)
[03:07] <LynnSM> Awww...
[03:07] <AlishaK2> Lynn, wonder if my muse is with yours...
[03:07] <Mouserocks> Mine too... want thai food. Or chinese food. 
[03:07] <VickiM> awww, so sweet Corrina!  Shout out to Greg!
[03:08] <lncroxmysox> *claps*
[03:08] <Corrina> Thanks, everyone!
[03:08] <hachiban> Go Greg!
[03:08] <LynnSM> Maybe thy're at an amusement park?
[03:08] <VickiM> don't ask me...mine went on a 6 year sabatical without my permission
[03:08] <ChiefPam> I'm betting Tahiti.  We should fly there and look
[03:08] <AlishaK2> Knowing my muse, they could be anywhere, and I mean *any*where
[03:08] <LynnSM> Superman airline?
[03:08] <VirginiaR> According to Lynn, Goo looks like Clark so maybe they're just following him around, that's why Corrina's stories are so good.
[03:08] <VickiM> check under the couch cushions - lost stuff *always* winds up there
[03:09] <CarolM> my muse tends to like the caribbean... who's with me?
[03:09] <LynnSM> Actually, I made a point of never describing the muses' appearance, since I had no idea how Corrina envisioned Goo.
[03:09] <ChiefPam> Okay, I guess I've got to go... kids are yelling "mooo-ooom"
[03:09] <VickiM> Ok!  Mine's not lost, but maybe she wants a friend!
[03:09] <ChiefPam> I've had a wonderful time tonight, thanks everyone!
[03:09] <VickiM> Night Pam :)
[03:09] <CarolM> night pam!

[21:51] <KateB> I can see you on kearthawards Vicki. Good job.
[21:51] <VirginiaR> Yea! People!  It's amazing what a "a" in front of awards can do?  Darn.  Phone!
[21:51] <KateB> Sorry, Virginia not Vicky
[21:51] <KellyM> lol  that's okay, I had it spelled "kertawards"
[21:51] <VickiM> lol
[21:52] <NostalgiaKic> Oh dear, my brother says his flat is leaking like a sieve. Not good
[21:52] <VickiM> Hukd on foniks reely wurkd for us
[21:52] <amberlea> does anyone here have the sounds installed? I have them, but I'm not going to mess with them if no one else has them
[21:52] <KellyM> not me.
[21:53] <KellyM> kvirc doesn't do sounds
[21:53] <BobB> I have sounds.  At least, they are supposed to be here,
[21:53] <VirginiaR> Hi Michael!
[21:53] <VickiM> I have them
[21:53] <NostalgiaKic> Nope... I was going to, but decided it was way too early to try and remember how to use them lol
[21:53] <Mouserocks> i decided to try out the sounds this year, but then my speakers broke :(((
[21:53] <VickiM> aww
[21:53] <VirginiaR> I'm back.  Kids out of the house.  Hubby called into work.  :(  But at least I made it!
[21:54] <KellyM> it's sunny, breezy and 80 here
[21:54] <KellyM> I'm tempted to take the laptop outside
[21:54] [amberlea SOUND]
[21:54] <VirginiaR> Sounds like here, Kelly.  Ma Nature has decided to go from winter to spring.
[21:54] <BobB> I heard that!  :)
[21:54] <VirginiaR> Sorry, summer
[21:54] <NostalgiaKic> It's not even dawn yet here lol
[21:54] <VickiM> I'm stealing time while the girls nap and my hubby chats with his folks (who are here)
[21:55] <VickiM> It's 70 here and goooooorgeous
[21:55] <VirginiaR> I think sounds are above my learning curve skill level.
[21:55] * VickiM is super happy
[21:55] <Mouserocks> Nice Vicki! 70's here to i love it!
[21:55] <KellyM> Sue would be here, but she's lounging on a beach at the moment

[21:56] <VickiM> lol
[21:56] <VirginiaR> Okay.  Next technical question.  My kerthchat and kerth awards are within the same window and I can't see both at the same time.  Is there a way to separate them?  Or do I need to start over with a new window?
[21:56] <KKent> Hey everyone.  I made it.  This is so wierd.
[21:56] <KateB> I don't have sounds
[21:56] <KellyM> And i'm watching the Cardinals steamroller the Cubs

[21:57] <KellyM> open, even
[21:57] <DarthMichael> Virginia, depending on what kind of chat program you use, there might be an option for that in the window-menu in the menu bar
[21:57] <amberlea> just don't get lost!  :)
[21:58] <VickiM> Kells, are you in lanekent too?

[22:53] <KateB> I don't think Clark even tasted it
[22:53] <KellyM> that's because he was too besotted  ;)
[22:53] <VirginiaR> A great chef always tastes.

[22:59] <VirginiaR> You'd love it, Michael.  Bob got his Evil Badge on that one.
[22:59] <DarthMichael> ooooooo

[23:01] <Nan> HIk!
[23:02] <KateB> hi Nan, you made it
[23:02] <Nan> Hold on. I have to get onto kerthawards, too
[23:03] <VirginiaR> Lex Luthor volunteers to come up one stage and model some of his custom suits.
[23:04] <NostalgiaKic> Why are they all double breasted? It bugs me
[23:04] * VickiM puts glasses on Michael *poof* he's a different person
[23:04] <VirginiaR> To hide all of his breasts.
[23:04] * VirginiaR ducks
[23:04] <VickiM> err...Amber...brain fail
[23:05] <VirginiaR> only 75%
[23:05] <VirginiaR> ?
[23:05] <KateB> wow
[23:05] <KellyM> The statistics you are about to see in this segment are wholly fictional and made up out of whole cloth.
[23:05] <amberlea> don't miss the disclaimer  :)
[23:05] <Nan> Hi, Kelly. Texas is great! Where we are it's green and beautiful. I love it.
[23:05] <KKent> Well, it depends on if you are classing the Revelation as the main plot point.  It's bound to happen even in stories where the plot is something else entirely
[23:05] <VirginiaR> Hey!  I can understand math like that!
[23:05] <BobB> I think I've had a revelation to SOMEONE in almost every story I've written.
[23:06] <VirginiaR> Someone should write a story about Clark learning Clark's Superman
[23:06] <KKent> lol
[23:06] * KateB chuckles
[23:06] <Corrina> ASU?
[23:06] <VirginiaR> I've written ONE where she wasn't mad.  But it was an Nfic.
[23:06] <KellyM> One of my favs was when someone else realizes that he's Superman, and everyone at the DP knows and has to tell the newbie NOT to tell Clark
[23:06] <Nan> I have no sound, but at least I'm here
[23:06] <BobB> Clark learning Clark's secret. I actually have one that has not been published.
[23:06] * KKent nods
[23:07] <KellyM> And now that Amber has blinded us with math....
[23:07] <VirginiaR> That's a good one, Kelly.
[23:07] <DarthMichael> there's also one on the archives about clark not knowing that he's moonlighting as Superman
[23:07] <NostalgiaKic> It's too early for statistics lol
[23:07] <KateB> When can you publish it, Bob?
[23:08] <NostalgiaKic> brb again
[23:08] * VirginiaR applauds KatherineKent
[23:08] * VirginiaR applauds Thomas and Corrina
[23:08] <BobB> The "story" is all "revelation gimic" and no story.  When I find the stroy, I'll publish it.
[23:08] <KateB> I'm always waiting for your stories, Bob
[23:08] * VirginiaR applauds Mozartmaid having just been sucked back into this story again recently.
[23:09] * VirginiaR applauds Mouse!
[23:09] * KateB applauds all the authors
[23:09] <Meadowlark> Well, gimics are good, too
[23:09] * KKent applauds a nominees then goes back to biting her fingernails again

[23:12] * KKent stares at eh Sundae thinking ... it's not gonna help, except to pile on the pounds ... then eats it anyway
[23:12] <KellyM> it's a celebratory sundae
[23:12] <VirginiaR> It will save what's left of your fingernails.
[23:12] <Nan> Celebratory sundaes don't count.
[23:12] <KellyM> Right
[23:12] <KKent> Ahhh, keep my fingers occupied eh? 
[23:12] * VirginiaR taps her sundae against Katherine Kent's
[23:13] <KKent> Oh yeah. Doesn't count, like food from someone else plate *nods*
[23:13] <Nan> exactly
[23:13] <NostalgiaKic> Or broken cookies
[23:13] <VirginiaR> If we overdose on sugar maybe some hero will have to fly us to a hospital.
[23:13] * DarthMichael laughs
[23:13] <Meadowlark> I want to thank KK for a new meaning to "wet T-Shirt"  
[23:13] <Nan> or cookie dough.

[23:14] <Deja_Vu> Poor Amber!! Thanks for all your hard work!!

[23:14] <Deja_Vu> LOL
[23:14] <VickiM> maaaaaaaybe
[23:15] <VirginiaR> I doubt vodka would help with a sore throat.  Better make it a White Russian
[23:15] <VirginiaR> With blended ice
[23:15] <NostalgiaKic> Water, vodka, they're the same thing right? :P
[23:15] <Nan> absolutely
[23:15] <KKent> Look the same to me ... see through
[23:15] <KellyM> or, as my aunt calls them after she's had a few, 'white wussions'
[23:15] <amberlea> wait, no one told me I could drink on the job!
[23:16] <VirginiaR> Ellen Lane suggests putting it in a coffee mug and nobody will know.
